            <h2>About The Recommender</h2>
            
            <p>
              The recommender system compares your survey answers with text from each programâ€™s website. 
              After calculating a similarity score for content and tone, it presents a ranked list. 
              I chose this method because in my experience, the most important thing in brain retraining and recovery, 
              at least at first, is that it resonates with you.
            </p>

            <p>
              This service will always be free to use, and I will never accept money to promote one program above another. 
              My goal is to provide the best recommendation I can based on your input.
            </p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>My name is Kendall Berry, I am a Physics PhD with a research background in computational neuroscience.
              I had CFS for a total of 3 years before fully recovering (read more about me and my recovery story <a href="/my-story" style="color: var(--primary-green);">here</a>). 
              Brain retraining was crucial to my recovery, and this project
              is my way of giving back to the ME/CFS community.</p>
