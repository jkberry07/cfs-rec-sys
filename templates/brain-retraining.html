            <h2>What is Brain Retraining/Nervous System Regulation?</h2>
            <p>Brain retraining and nervous system regulation operate under the theory that ME/CFS and related conditions
                 are driven by (but not solely caused by) dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. In a nutshell, it 
                 posits that the body’s balance between sympathetic (fight or flight) and parasympathetic (rest and digest) 
                 is unstable, preventing the body from recovering from things that other people recover from, or from tolerating 
                 the same level of exertion or environmental stressors that other people can tolerate.</p>
            <p>Nervous system regulation aims to do just what it says, regulate the autonomic nervous system 
                so the body operates in a balanced way. It encompasses both bottom-up (body-focused) and top-down (mind-focused) 
                exercises. The bottom-up practices can be things like breathing exercises, vagus nerve toning or somatics. 
                Examples of top-down practices are meditation, mindfulness, and brain retraining. The goal of brain retraining 
                is to help you to establish a more relaxed baseline and to react to things in a more calm and confident way.</p>
            <p>Functionally, brain retraining often looks like this:</p>  
            <li>Take a break from whatever you’re doing</li> 
            <li>Make a choice to react differently</li> 
            <li>Do a visualization.</li> 
            <p>Each program teaches this process its own way, with slightly different steps, different focuses, and a different flavor. 
                For example, sometimes it will include a breathing exercise, or affirmations.</p>
            
            <p>To me, the benefit of these kind of exercises is their potential to benefit your physical and mental health 
                regardless of whether it leads to a full recovery (which is what happened in my case). At this point, 
                the positive impact of meditation and mindfulness are well-established (see links below). And because 
                brain retraining is individualized, it can be a powerful tool for personal growth. Ultimately, BR/NSR can
                lead to improvements, with a possibility of recovery, using practices that can benefit your life 
                regardless.</p>
            <p>After completing the survey and choosing your shortlist, I encourage you to explore the programs’ websites and learn how they talk about it.</p>
