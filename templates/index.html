            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>This site is intended to help people with ME/CFS or related chronic conditions to find a brain retraining/nervous system regulation program that resonates with their goals and values.</p>
            
            <p>Many people with ME/CFS or related chronic illnesses (including myself) have seen significant improvements and even recovery with brain retraining/nervous system regulation programs (<a href="#" style="color: var(--primary-green);">to learn more about what is involved in brain retraining/nervous system regulation, click here</a>). When choosing to pursue this route, it can be challenging to pick from among the programs that are out there. This site is designed to make that process easier.</p>
            
            <p>Before taking the survey to generate the recommendations, a few notes of advice. Those who make progress using brain retraining and nervous system regulation truly commit to doing this work. And it is work. It can also be very rewarding on a deeply personal level. Brain retraining/nervous system regulation involves a lot of self-reflection and inner work, so it's important to find a program that resonates with how you think about yourself, your life, and your values. My primary advice is to choose a program that you believe will be good for your life regardless of recovery. And finally, make any practices you learn your own; focus on the ones that resonate with you, do them in a way that you enjoy.</p>
            
            <p>In the survey below, you will respond to three short-answer questions of your choice. The recommender system will compare your answers to text from recovery programs and show you which may be the best fit. You can also set filters for price, coaching options, refundability, etc.</p>
