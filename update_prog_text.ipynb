    "ANSRewire_text = [\"Often, people that have tried many approaches for recovery from ME/CFS/Fibromyalgia/POTS/MCS and other versions of this condition with partial or little success, are interested to understand the specific tools and techniques in the program before they enrol.\", 'It is important however, to understand that recovery is NOT about any ONE specific tool or technique, but rather about a comprehensive approach tailored to your personal needs.', 'In order for you to tailor your personal recovery action plan using the tools, techniques, strategies and additional treatments discussed, it is key that you gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of the illness.', 'That is why education and understanding are so heavily featured in the ANS REWIRE program.', 'In other words, it is about understanding the answer to this question:', 'Understanding answers to such questions will help you to answer the most important questions including:', 'Hence the program is based on the fact that:', 'So whilst all people share common challenges and dysfunctions, that often require a common approach, we recognise that everyone still has some different needs.', 'This is why there is no single effective fix-all treatment for these conditions that works for everyone, no easy cure.', 'For example, a person experiencing severe pain has different challenges to a person experiencing MCS.', 'And in turn, a bedridden person may need different additional treatment needs to somebody that is more mobile.', 'So the program is more than a collection of strategies or a “protocol” for recovery, it is about you using the education, information, tools, strategies and training to tailor your PERSONAL ACTION PLAN for recovery.', 'It is about guiding you to explore answers to the above questions and to seek additional help from health care professionals where needed as part of your holistic recovery action plan, to tip your nervous system back into normal functioning.', 'The program consists of five categories including: Think of the program as having somebody in your life each day, to guide you and help you plan your recovery, somebody who understands what you are going through and who can motivate you to do what you need to do.', 'This is why the lessons are delivered one day at a time, so that you can build on your knowledge and give yourself time to take the action you need to recover.', 'The first 2 weeks of the program focuses largely on understanding the mechanism and dynamics of the illness, which we believe is the key for long-term success.', 'This forms the foundation for the techniques and strategies that you will learn later in the program.', 'Here we address the 4 key physical triggers of the illness.', 'This category is made up of specific education and strategies to reduce these triggers to help you create a healing environment and start your journey towards recovery.', 'This includes: The lessons are strongly focussed on understanding the reasons behind the differences in people’s experiences.', 'For example, it addresses the conundrum of many people experiencing a significant worsening of their condition with increased exercise, whilst others benefit from it.', 'This understanding and the distinctions are then available to allow you to avoid the pitfalls, and to start using physical exercise for improved function and recovery.', 'Once a foundation of understanding has been laid out, we move into a range of brain training.', 'This includes a number of strategies and techniques that you can customise to your own preference and experience, to more directly address the neurological dysfunctions, including the maladaptive stress response and pain sensitisation.', 'The training includes: Finally there are also some additional video lessons that address circumstances where some people might seek specific medical treatments, including: The lessons help put these additional treatments into context, provide some background information and share some key distinctions for success.', 'So the program consists of over 40 online lessons which are designed to guide you in your recovery journey and help you take these important steps: Understand what is going on.', 'Learn what you need to do and how to do it.', 'Take the daily action steps to move you forward.', 'The daily action steps that are part of the program, vary depending on the topic of the lesson.', 'Some examples of simple steps are: The daily action steps can also include adding specific strategies to your daily action list, including such things as: The program includes an online component and audio training.', 'The program is available online with the delivery of one lesson per day over a period of around 6 weeks.', 'This ensures that you can complete the daily action tasks and build up your understanding before commencing specific strategies and brain training for your recovery!', 'This includes 3 components: Utilises Brainwave Entrainment Technology!', 'Brainwave Entrainment Music uses an audio technology known as binaural beats as well as isochronic tones, monaural beats and amplitude modulation.', 'These assist in bringing about desirable changes in brainwave activity to encourage states of relaxation, deep meditation or sleep.', \"It's important that you feel comfortable with the Pros and Cons of the program and make a commitment to the process when you enrol.\", 'As I write this, I wonder if this is perhaps my most important blog for people experiencing ME/CFS, Fibromyalgia, POTS and MCS to date!', 'In a recent recovery snippet, I spoke about the problem with overwhelm of information when it comes to ME/CFS/Fibromyalgia.', 'And it made me reflect on my own efforts to help the wider ME/CFS/Fibromyalgia community including publishing CFS Unravelled 3.5 years ago.', 'It has been wonderful to get so much positive feedback about CFS Unravelled over the years.', 'Much of it has been about appreciating the detail on how the dysfunctions we experienced in Fibromyalgia/ME/CFS occur.', 'But occasionally, even my staunchest followers (dare I say fans), suddenly see a post or see me share a recovery story of someone who used a particular approach they don’t like, and express disappointment.', 'Whilst I may or may not agree with some approaches, in the end what really counts is when something works for someone.', 'So it’s not so much about whether we agree with their approach, but rather about understanding WHY it worked for that person.', 'The real problem is that despite my summarising comments in CFS Unravelled, because there is so much information, and because inevitably we always focus on and filter information according to our own interest, the message sometimes get lost.', 'So here is my effort to bring clarity to the whole message behind the ME/CFS/Fibromyalgia/POTS/MCS pathogenesis and the recovery framework: My message is this – ME/CFS/Fibromyalgia/POTS/MCS is a one illness, with a huge list of dysfunctions and ways symptoms are created, and how most of this happens is understood!', 'HOWEVER, treating these dysfunctions whilst helpful, in isolation rarely produces lasting results, let alone a recovery from the illness.', 'When I was ill, one of my biggest frustration when seeing physicians and alternative practitioners was that whilst their treatments addressed problems, they never answered me WHY these problems were occurring.', 'And whilst some of these dysfunctions perpetuate in their own right, or are triggered by other dysfunctions, the whole point of CFS Unravelled was that SOMETHING has to be creating all these problems in the first place.', 'And in the book I explain how I came to the inevitable conclusion, that the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) is that something and how neuroplasticity is central to recovery from the illness.', 'Sometimes metaphors are a good way for us to get our head around things.', 'I often share this one about ME/CFS/Fibromyalgia/POTS/MCS recovery: Imagine you come home, and your kitchen is flooded with water.', 'What do you do?', 'Well, it’s only natural to clean it up – wipe it up, mop it up, dry it – yes?', 'THEN WHAT?', 'Do you just say, OK that’s fixed?', 'The next day you come home, you see the kitchen floor is covered in water again.', 'Mop it up again?', 'What about the next day?', 'The day after that?', 'OBVIOUSLY, we don’t just clean up the mess without finding out what is wrong.', 'Is there a broken pipe?', 'A leak in the roof?', 'Some other obvious SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM?', 'I tell this little metaphor, because whilst it seems completely obvious that in life we look for a reason for our problems, it seems in the health world that we just focus on fixing it a lot of the time, which in my view is not logical.', 'For example: ETC.', 'ETC.', 'ETC.', '(lets face it, I could fill pages with that train of thought) Surely, the first question has to be WHY these problems are occurring, rather than just how to ‘fix’ them.', 'Because only once you address the root problem (broken pipe or leak in the roof) that is creating the symptoms (The puddle on the kitchen floor), are you really going to make a lasting change - right?', 'Hence my repeated message that I have been working so hard to make clear to others seeking recovery from this syndrome: Now, notice I said, not JUST the consequences.', 'Because of course, (returning to our metaphor), if you realised that the pipe under the sink was leaking water, surely besides fixing the pipe, you would also replace the swollen cupboard doors that no longer shut.', 'And you would ensure that the carpet in the adjoining room is dried out as well as the kitchen tiles.', 'The water marks on the skirting boards are addressed and so on.', 'If you have been listening to recovery interviews, then perhaps you have glimpsed some common themes and approaches.', 'Heard about common physical treatments, common mind/body approaches but also common changes in terms of how people look at the illness and how they approach life.', 'So how does that fit together?', 'Well, let’s start by stating the obvious – the Autonomic Nervous System is in the brain!', 'And of course, anyone who has experienced chronic pain (research has shown that the ongoing pain in fibromyalgia is primarily caused by central sensitisation where the brain experiences pain more strongly than in normal healthy people), brain fog, irritability, mood swings and sensitivity to lights, sounds and touch, can clearly see that there are issues in how the brain functions.', 'So clearly, that means we need to focus on changing how the brain functions!', 'You might even ask, is that even possible?', 'Even though most physicians trained last century were emphatically told that the brain is fixed by the time we reach adulthood, wonderful research scientists like Dr Michael Merzenich have proven that this is not the case and opened up the science on neuroplasticity.', 'Neuroplasticity, meaning that the brain is plastic, that it has the ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life, and pruning old ones no longer used.', 'Neuroplasticity allows nerve cells in our brain to compensate for injury and disease and to adjust their activities in response to new situations or to changes in their environment.', 'In other words, our brain can unlearn how to feel excessive pain.', 'Our brain can unlearn to react inappropriately to stimulus, like lights, smells, sounds and even physical stressors like low blood sugar, poor gut function and so on.', 'Of course, inappropriate responses to psychological stressors can also be retrained, but this has been long-known and much more acceptable in the field of psychology.', 'So if we want to effect change in how the brain works, if we want to affect neuroplasticity for ME/CFS/Fibromyalgia/POTS/MCS, we have to do BRAIN TRAINING.', 'But what does that mean?', 'Well, most people think of brain training as something that is mental.', 'And of course, that is the most direct route.', 'People train their brain to remember things, to be able to do special things like computations, or respond faster like you might see in a fighter pilot or athlete.', 'But brain training for healing as opposed to performance can take multiple forms.', 'A good example of this is stroke victims, where a part of the brain stops working leaving them unable to perform physical activities like walking or speaking.', 'The solution?', 'BRAIN TRAINING!', 'Their brain training is usually done with a physical therapist, where they re-learn to move their legs.', 'It’s a combination of physical and mental efforts and feedback.', 'So not only is it about attempting to engage in movement with our mind, but also the feedback from our body.', 'So by someone moving the body for the stroke-affected person, their brain is being trained to refire the appropriate nerves to engage those muscles.', 'And once they are able to somewhat engage their muscles with their mind, the learning can accelerate.', 'In ME/CFS/Fibromyalgia, the issues are of course quite different than in a person with a stroke.', 'It is more about dysfunction than injury per se.', 'But the same lessons and opportunities to retrain the brain still apply.', 'For example, pain psychologists have been using the insights gained from researchers for many years now, to help tune down excessive chronic pain for people like burn victims in hospitals.', 'But whilst it’s my absolute conviction that all people experiencing ME/CFS/Fibromyalgia/POTS/CFIDS/MCS/EMHS all share the same root ANS dysfunction, we must recognise that there is still a great deal of variation, not just in terms of the secondary dysfunctions and symptoms, but also in the way the illness is triggered.', 'And hence the need for a multi-lateral approach where your brain training is customised to your own experience and preference, but where you also support and treat severe physical imbalances and dysfunctions to assist with recovery and reduce the pressure on the ANS.']\n",

Chronic illness often overlaps with mental illness, such as depression and anxiety, making self-acceptance all the more critical.', 'An accepting mindset reduces self-blame, fosters self-compassion, and helps individuals develop coping statements like “I can handle this moment” or “I am more than my diagnosis.” Through Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), mental health support encourages individuals to observe their thoughts, feelings, and experiences without attachment.', 'Rather than trying to change these internal experiences, ACT invites individuals to live in alignment with their values—despite the presence of pain.', 'One of the most exciting applications of acceptance lies in its connection with brain retraining and neuroplasticity.', 'Neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to change its structure and function based on experience and repeated thought patterns.', 'Chronic stress, fear, and resistance can keep the nervous system in a state of hypervigilance.', 'By practicing acceptance, we reduce stress signals to the brain and calm the limbic system– the fear center of the brain–allowing for a shift from a survival response to a healing state.', 'This is where brain retraining comes in: through visualization, mindfulness, somatic exercises, and cognitive re-framing, individuals can reshape their neural pathways to support health and well-being.', 'Acceptance is the first step toward releasing negative thoughts, embracing self-discovery, and unlocking the brain’s natural capacity for change.', 'Practicing acceptance doesn’t mean you stop seeking improvement.', 'Instead, it becomes your foundation for growth.', 'Here are practical ways to develop a more accepting mindset: Name what you’re experiencing—whether it’s physical pain, fatigue, or fear—without labeling it as good or bad.', 'This non-judgmental awareness builds self-awareness and reduces emotional reactivity.', 'Say to yourself: “This is hard, and I’m doing my best,” or “I can feel this emotion without it controlling me.” These phrases foster true acceptance and soothe the nervous system.', 'Instead of focusing on what you can’t do, ask: “What small action can I take today that supports my personal growth and health?” Mindfulness and brain retraining practices help you develop new associations with your symptoms and shift into a more accepting mindset over time.', 'You don’t have to do this alone.', 'Talking to others, sharing your experience, and receiving compassion can help you feel accepted and understood.', 'Acceptance is not resignation—it is a conscious, empowering choice to meet life as it is while still holding space for growth, change, and healing.', 'For those navigating chronic illness, it becomes a foundational practice that shifts the focus from control and resistance to presence and resilience.', 'By embracing acceptance through mindset work, therapeutic support, and brain retraining, individuals can reduce stress, reconnect with their sense of self, and open the door to emotional freedom and improved well-being.', 'True acceptance allows us to stop fighting the moment and start living it—creating space for both peace and possibility on the path to healing.', 'The re-origin program is designed to help you change your relationship with your chronic illness while cultivating opportunities for healing and growth.', 'We’ve helped thousands of people heal with these practices.', 'Learn more about the re-origin program here.', 'The main idea of acceptance is acknowledging and allowing experiences, emotions, or situations

program.', 'In the program, you work through 6 modules of virtual classes and practice 30 minutes per day of re-training exercises.', 'You can join weekly group calls, group coaching, and virtual events to encourage you and keep you on track.', 'The course, coaching, and community support you to rewire your brain and feel like yourself again, all with scientifically-backed and proven methods that you can rely on to shift persistent symptoms.', 'Simply put, neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to change, both structurally and functionally, throughout a person’s lifetime.', 'This ability to change helps promote: The ability to learn new things.', 'The ability to enhance existing cognitive capabilities.', 'Recovery from strokes and traumatic brain injuries.', 'Strengthening certain areas of the brain that have lost function.', 'Recovery from limbic system impairments, commonly resulting in fibromyalgia, CFS/ME, and depression.', 'How does neuroplasticity work?', 'Our brains discard unused neural pathways… and strengthen new ones based on our habits.', 'When we experience something new, our brain creates new connections between neurons so we can remember how to do a certain task.', 'The repetition of every action, emotion, or thought reinforces a particular neural pathway in our brain.', 'The more the actions, emotions, and thoughts are repeated, the more deeply these neural pathways become ingrained in the circuitry of our brains.', 'That’s why the more you practice something, be it playing the guitar or speaking Spanish, the better you get at it.', 'Neurons that are used frequently develop stronger connections, while those that are rarely or never used are eventually eliminated.', 'This process is known as synaptic pruning.', 'By developing new connections and pruning away weak ones, the brain is able to continuously adapt to its changing environment.', 'This is really exciting information, as it means that we can actually train our brain to let go of unfavorable neural pathways, replacing them with beneficial neural pathways.', 'When impaired in this way, the limbic system continuously sends out alarm signals that stimulate the nervous system and immune system as if a threat is present, even though there is no threat or it’s long gone.', 'The combination of stressors essentially overwhelms the brain, causing it to go into an extreme survival mode in which it’s hypersensitive and hyper-reactive.', 'In many cases, limbic system impairments arise when someone experiences a traumatic event while their chronic stress load is already high.', 'For instance, someone who gets in a car accident or contracts a virus while going through a divorce has a higher risk of developing a limbic system impairment.', 'Neuroplasticity has both a positive and negative side.', 'Limbic system impairments are an example of the negative side of neuroplasticity.', 'The limbic system is the part of the brain that drives your primal fight or flight response.', 'Changes to this system can lead to a wide variety of negative symptoms and conditions, such as depression, anxiety, OCD, sensitivities, chronic pain, and chronic fatigue syndrome, just to name a few.', 'It’s important to understand, however, that if you’re suffering from a limbic system impairment, it’s not your fault.', 'Limbic system impairments occur unconsciously as the result of trauma and chronic stress.', 'These faulty neural pathways ultimately become conditioned, meaning they get stuck in an unconscious loop that perpetuates itself.', 'This continuous stimulation of the nervous system and the immune system keeps the brain and body locked in an unconscious defense cycle, opening the door to ongoing inflammation in the body and a number of different symptoms and sensitivities.', 'You can re-train your brain toward health with a few simple techniques.', 'Negative changes may have occurred in your brain, but remember, neuroplasticity goes two ways.', 'This means that any changes your brain has learned can be undone, allowing you to reclaim your peace, happiness, and health.', 'Your brain is not stuck—it simply needs some retraining that threats are no longer present and it can calm down.', 'That’s where re-origin comes in.', 're-origin is a science-backed neuroplasticity-based treatment program that can teach you how to eliminate the dysfunctional neural pathways that are perpetuating your chronic health conditions.', 'As you’ll learn through our program, there are certain factors that can increase neuroplasticity, including repetition, strong emotions, language, imagery, and other specific neurocognitive exercises.', 'While neuroplasticity is something that happens on a day-to-day basis beyond our conscious awareness, it is also something that we can actively influence and encourage.', 'Through re-origin, you’ll learn to apply an easy-to-follow, five-step neurocognitive technique to directly retrain the unconscio us nervous and immune system responses that are at the root of your symptoms.', 're-origin’s approach does not chase or mask symptoms, but rather works to rewire the part of the brain that’s causing the dysfunction (the limbic system), resulting in long-lasting recovery.', 'The program is easy to follow, self-directed, cost-effective, and takes just minutes a day to implement.', 'Plus, re-origin offers access to a community and coaching specifically geared towards helping people retrain their own brains and return to feeling like themselves.', 'Our program is based on decades of research and development and

they are talking about the same thing,\\xa0in different ways, or from different angles.', 'Whatever you’re doing in recovery, a true understanding of MECFS is to me, Pillar #1 (of the 4 pillars that I speak about so often, and you can learn more about here), and the foundation by which everything else is built upon thereafter.', \"So I'm going to lay it out for you here; my understanding, as clear and concise as possible as to what is going on in MECFS.\", 'What actually is MECFS?', 'MECFS has been classified at the nuero-immune institute of south west Florida, (where one of the greatest research scientist of our days, Dr. Nancy Klimas does nothing but live, breathe and sleep MECFS research), as a \"neuro-immue\" disease.Note: The neuroimmune system is a complex system of the body, that describes interactions between the nervous and immune system, which are hard-wired to each other.', 'That means that unlike an “auto-immune” disease in which the body is attacking itself, this is a disease in which the nervous system and the immune system are acting disproportionately, and have lost a sense of balance to sustain homeostasis.', 'The other systems, such as cellular, neuro-endocrine, metabolism, and central nervous system, also help to main homeostasis, and because all of these systems work together in a beautifully, highly intelligent, almost inconceivably perfect way, what impacts one for the positive, impacts the other.', 'This also means, what triggers/strains one, will trigger/strain the other.', '(Note: when I was attending, they were doing tests on rats to try to find a “homeostasis reset” button and then see if it could then be implemented into humans, but no luck thus far.)', 'What I was taught at the institute, is that because homeostasis has been lost, and the stress response and rest/digest response are both not working properly, we must work as we can to normalize the stress response, so the body can find balance.', 'All the other systems however, will continue to trigger each other, and can in it of themselves, trigger the stress response.', 'This is why brain retraining as a stand alone approach cannot work for everyone; because if you have high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid issues, all of which remain unresolved, or even mold, heavy metals or other burdens on the nervous system, those will trigger it bottom to top, which has a cascading impact back down onto the systems.', 'That is the nature of the illness; which is after all, bi-directional.', 'Likewise if you have deep trauma, PTSD etc, the same ideas apply as having mold or thyroid issues; how trauma is stuck and stored in the body and the way it impacts the body is also something that has a bi-directional impact on MECFS.', 'Whatever we do, we must try to help the body return to homeostasis.', 'The reason why mind-body appraoches can be so powerful is because of the way the limbic system, where we process signals of danger or safety and make sense of them with emotion, plays into our stress response.', \"A stress response that through conditioning and through crashes, has become more highly sensitive, resulting in a greater imbalance in the way it's triggered, and also greater physiological distress, CAN be reshaped through neuroplasticity and returned to normal.\", \"This reshaping has a very real impact on our body's ability to find balance and heal, as the rest/digest\\xa0and fight/flight responses return to normal.\", 'I believe the body is ALWAYS trying to return to homeostasis, and so much of what I did in recovery was about getting out of its way, while letting it do what it was trying to do.', 'All my efforts, even pharmaceutical intervention, were in an attempt to nudge it back to balance.', 'It was as if it had amnesia, and lost its way and I just kept reminding it of who it was and how it functions.', 'And every system that I supported, would eventually trigger every other system less and less.', 'So much of what I had to do was working with all triggers; environmental, emotional, physiological and psychological.', 'That means that brain retraining and somatics were not the entire puzzle for me; but a piece of what I call “the four pillars” of recovery.', 'Recovery for many, myself included requires a multi-faceted approach.', 'However, the reason we work with the ANS the most, is because, without dealing with our stress response, all the other systems which can be so greatly impacted by holistic methods and functional medicine (like the $15,000 I spent on HBOT and ozone therapy which truly helped), will get shot to hell if we have a huge stress trigger again.', 'Likewise, if we ONLY do \"brain-retraining,\" and this serves us to gaslight ourselves into ignoring the body\\'s very real limits, we will stress our physiology, causing negative upwards changes onto the brain and the ANS, and as a result, create more dis-ease in both.', \"If you're in need of guidance, support, have questions about my coaching, or just need someone to listen, feel free to book a discovery call with me.\", 'Receive notification for open enrollment periods for The Edison Effect, as well as carefully curated guidance, insights of living/loving & healing from Anj by joining her newsletter.', 'We hate SPAM.', 'We will never sell your information, for any reason.']\n",

    "DNRS_text = ['Founder of the DNRS program Annie Hopper, and the coaching team took a deep dive into exploring the realm of emotions and the work of Dr. Candace Pert, a former professor at the Georgetown School of Medicine, author of Molecules of Emotion, Everything You Need to Know to Feel Go(o)d, and more than 250 scientific articles.', 'We provide a breakdown of their discussion on the science behind boosting your emotional state, and why it matters when it comes to health and healing.', 'What we experience as an emotion are chemicals (molecules of emotion) vibrating at cell receptor sites that are located throughout the brain and body.', 'Emotions are powerful signalling molecules that send a message to the cell and DNA within the cell what to do – should I be in a growth state, or should I be in a protective state?', 'Positive emotions pave the way for moving the cell into a growth state, where substances can enter the cell and signal the DNA to create proteins needed for regeneration and repair.', 'We can also regulate pain signals and immune function through elevating our emotional state.', 'Moreover, our emotional state dictates what memories are accessed and what neural networks in the brain are engaged and strengthened.', 'Understanding how our emotions are impacted with limbic system impairment and how we can utilize cultivating positive emotions as a tool to assist us in rewiring our brain is pivotal to the healing process.', 'Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor, neuroscientist and author of My Stroke of Insight suggests that in a healthy brain, emotions typically last around 90 seconds.', 'Lingering negative emotions may indicate a stuck survival response, (as seen with limbic system impairment) or the story we attach to it.', 'When the world is viewed through an unconscious lens of threat, it alters how we perceive the environment, and how we relate to the world and the people in it.', 'The most common emotions associated with limbic system impairment are fear, sadness, despair, anger, hopelessness, and worry.', 'This makes sense when the brain is constantly on the lookout for potential threats.', 'Remember, this is not the person’s fault – the brain may be stuck in a survival response.', 'Please keep in mind that we don’t need to fear survival-related emotions as sometimes these emotions are healthy and appropriate.', 'However, moving into a state of growth requires that we provide the brain and body with a context of safety, and we can do so by choosing to cultivate and soak our brains and bodies with the chemical signature produced by positive emotions.', 'With DNRS we are using our conscious control of emotions (by using our prefrontal cortex to choose to elevate our emotional state, even when we don’t feel like it) to create a chemical state that overrides the threat response, and helps the brain and body move into a state of repair and regeneration.', 'This is not a process of emotional denial, rather, this is an understanding of the power of emotions.', 'Simply put, we use the science of emotion to help facilitate rewiring the brain.', 'Even when we don’t genuinely feel positive, we can exercise our brain and choose to cultivate a positive emotional state.', 'With time and repetition, we can change our emotional landscape and gain greater access to the full realm of emotions, in a healthy and balanced way.', 'In the beginning, cultivating a positive emotional state when you are suffering from limbic system impairment can seem challenging.', 'However, with repetition, it gets easier and feels more natural.', 'Using a support service like our Share-a-Laugh classes, doing full rounds of the DNRS retraining steps, and listening to uplifting music can assist you greatly in this endeavour.', 'Keep in mind that we are shifting not just to peace and calm but shifting the emotional pendulum all the way to a sense of joy, connection, love, awe or gratitude.', 'Peace and calm are stepping stones to these.', 'The more often we cultivate positive emotions, the easier it gets.', 'The more time we spend soaking and marinating in this state, the greater the benefit on our health and our emotional well-being!', 'The Dynamic Neural Retraining System is a self-guided brain retraining program that uses the principles of neuroplasticity to help reverse limbic system impairment and regulate a maladaptive chronic stress response that is often the cause of a long list of chronic conditions and symptoms.', 'The DNRS program includes a comprehensive instructional online video program, as well as a variety of optional support services that are available at any point during your recovery journey.', 'After purchasing the program, you will have access to a series of streaming instructional videos with up to 12 hours of educational content and proven and powerful brain-retraining techniques.', 'If you have just purchased the DNRS program and are looking for tips on how to make the most of your healing journey, this blog post is for you.', 'We will guide you through our recommendations for beginners as well as where to find a wealth of resources and education to support you as you progress through the program.', 'Starting the DNRS program is an exciting and empowering first step in your recovery journey.', 'Before you begin the program, make sure you have prepared an effective learning environment for yourself.', 'Remove any distractions that could get in the way of you giving your undivided attention.', 'The DNRS program is experiential and it is the consistent daily application of all elements of the program that leads to lasting changes in brain function and measurable improvements in physical, emotional, and psychological health.', 'Each component of the program is demonstrated for you in a methodical and easy-to-understand formula so you can integrate the tools you learn seamlessly into your daily life.', 'The five pillars of recovery with DNRS are: Pillar 1: Recognize the Link Between Your Brain and Your Condition.', 'This mindset introduces a new way of thinking about how brain function and nervous system dysregulation may be involved in your condition.', 'Pillar 2: Recognize and Redirect Pathways of the Past (POPs).', 'This is an awareness exercise that allows you to identify and change patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving to support the creation of new neural pathways.', 'Pillar 3: Practice Full Rounds of the DNRS Retraining Steps.', 'A specialized visualization technique that focuses on desensitizing and resetting the nervous system while promoting new neural pathways.', 'Pillar 4: Apply Incremental Training.', 'This pillar involves changing trauma associations and graduated exposure therapy (imaginary and real) to desensitize the brain, change fear associations and strengthen positive neural pathways that lead to optimal health.', 'Pillar 5: Elevate Your Emotional State:\\xa0 Elevating your emotional state helps to provide a cue of safety to the brain, allowing for the brain to move out of survival-related emotions and pave the way for positive neuroplastic changes.', 'Get Started With DNRS 2.0!', 'Included with your purchase of the DNRS program is a lifetime basic membership to the Global Community Forum.', 'There are over 15,000 members and 15 years of archived information within the forum, including dozens of resources applicable to implementing the DNRS program.', 'This includes everything from a welcoming community of like-minded people who are focused on healing with DNRS, recovery stories, recovery tips, recommended books, featured videos, examples of exercises and so much more.', 'Inside the forum, you will also find unparalleled inspiration, motivation and support from fellow DNRS participants.', 'We have seen countless lifelong friendships formed with people from around the world who met on the forum.', 'Professionally moderated and updated every day, it is the perfect space to support you as you navigate the DNRS program for the first time.', 'Ongoing Support Services are provided by Certified DNRS Coaches and Facilitators and are available once you have started

the DNRS program, are plugged into the global community forum and have found the right support service for you, we encourage you to explore other educational resources to enhance your understanding.', 'On the DNRS website, our NEWS section offers blogs and stories related to neuroplasticity that are chalked full of valuable insights into this fascinating field.', 'We also invite you to subscribe to our monthly newsletter where we share new research and articles as well as inspiring new testimonials from the DNRS community.', 'You can subscribe to our monthly newsletter here  To create new neural pathways, you need to consider three key principles of learning that will help you apply neuroplasticity: Focus, Association, and Repetition.', 'These principles form the acronym, FAR.', 'If you consistently apply these principles, you will go FAR toward your goal of optimal health.', 'Focus, Association, and Repetition each play an important role in learning and developing new neural connections needed to help rewire the brain.', 'When it comes to brain retraining, consistency is key.', 'If you are just starting your journey with DNRS and are feeling overwhelmed by where to start,

    "Gupta_text = [\"Neuroplasticity, also known as brain plasticity or neural plasticity, is the brain's ability to reorganize itself, both functionally and physically through the process of forming new neural connections throughout life.\", 'Without this ability, the brain would not be able to develop from infancy to adulthood.', \"Neuroplasticity allows the neurons (the brain's nerve cells) to compensate for disease and injury and to adjust their activities in response to new experiences, environment changes, behavior, thinking and emotions.\", 'Neuroplasticity is one of the hottest topics in neuroscience and has far-reaching implications & potential for most aspects of our lives.', 'However, the same characteristic that makes your brain resistant also renders it vulnerable to internal and external, often unconscious influences which can, unfortunately, result in people with certain risk factors developing these chronic conditions.', 'I call the conditions such as CFS/ME, Fibromyalgia, MCS and Related Conditions that we treat \"Neuro-Immune Conditioned Syndromes” or “NICS”.', 'These defence responses are all over the body, but I believe that they start off in the brain.', 'The Amygdala & Insula Hypothesis a ‘vicious cycle’ that, once triggered by severe stressors in people with certain risk factors can perpetuate neurological overstimulation, physiological dysfunction, and many physical symptoms.', 'These conditions are real physical illnesses in the body, and they are caused by the effects of a traumatic event on the brain.', 'This causes the brain to go into an extreme survival mode.', 'The brain becomes hypersensitive and hyper-reactive.', 'It is the brain which is over-triggering the sympathetic nervous system and the immune system.', 'And this is due to something called “conditioning” – It is when our brains learn to do something new, again and again.', 'In the brain, the conditioning may specifically occur in parts of the brain called the insula and the amygdala.', 'Please see more detailed information below: \\xa0 Our bodies have evolved so we can survive in our environment.', 'Our body’s number one priority is survival!', 'And there are threats that we face that can compromise our survival, and these can be of many different types.', 'It is called the sympathetic nervous system response.', 'And the opposite of the stress or sympathetic system is called the parasympathetic nervous system, often mediated by the vagus nerve.', 'This is when the body calms down and heals, rests, and repairs itself.', 'Most of our threats are actually not physical but more mental and emotional threats.', 'But our bodies keep responding as if they are real physical threats, for example, rejection or separation.', 'There are other defense responses too like pain responses, where the brain focuses our attention on the source of that pain; then it magnifies those pain signals and triggers aspects of the immune system.', 'The reason why traditional medicine finds it hard to treat these conditions, is because traditional medicine separates these two branches of medicine.', 'We have a separate immunology department, and a separate neurology department, and in fact a separate psychology department.', 'But the brain makes no difference between all of these different aspects of the body.', 'The brain simply says, “What do I have to do to survive?” and then the body triggers a unique pattern of defense responses to ensure survival.', 'For instance, when we have flu, our immune system is triggered but this also has an effect on our emotions and how we feel.', 'We feel like we just want to take a rest.', 'And biologically this is to ensure that healing occurs so that we survive.', 'Currently, I do not believe there are any pharmaceuticals that could target such a specific reaction in the brain.', 'Most pharmaceuticals or supplements target the symptoms rather than the underlying cause.', 'If conditioning is mild, successful treatment of symptoms may bring recovery, but in the majority of cases, this may not occur.', 'However, it is still important that you are guided by your Doctor.', 'Learn more the range of physical, cognitive and emotional symptoms that those with ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, and associated illnesses may experience – explaining how they may be products of amygdala hyper-sensitization.', 'Luckily the amygdala and insula constantly communicates with other parts of the brain, and that’s where retraining can take place.', 'Amygdala & Insula Retraining is designed to strengthen the prefrontal cortex and restore inhibitory mechanisms in the insula, anterior cingulate and other associated structures.', 'The unconscious brain reaction involved in amygdala and insula dysfunction is not normally under a patient’s control, but I believe that my highly specialized“brain retraining” techniques derived from NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming), breathing, meditation techniques, and others, can target the reaction and control the amygdala.', 'It is estimated that at least 2% to 5% of the population suffer from Fibromyalgia, a complex pain condition in some form, and until now there has been a lack of effective treatments.', \"The novel Neuroplasticity program known as “Amygdala and Insula Retraining” was combined with Mindfulness to create 'MAIR', also known as the Gupta Program, and was tested for 8 weeks against a control group engaging in an equivalent amount of relaxation techniques.\", 'The pilot study results found that after just an 8 week intervention, the MAIR group had significantly greater reductions in symptoms and pain, and increases in overall health, compared to the control group.', 'These are the key results from the 8-week study: 15 Brand new interactive video sessions online hot in the stunning mountains of Switzerland.', 'On topics such as diet, sleep, nutrition, mindfulness and pacing Get motivation & support throughout every step of your healing journey and have your questions answered directly by Ashok.', 'You will receive a Manual and Mind Map in the post.', 'Online there are numerous supporting audio exercises and meditations.', 'These easy to access resources will help deepen your recovery further.', 'Access to trained Gupta Program Coaches to tailor the program to your needs Full of like-minded individuals dedicated to health to help to support you through your recovery', 'Neuroplasticity – the brain’s innate ability to change and adapt – is currently a hot topic in neuroscience because it opens up many avenues for treating chronic conditions.', 'This means that the brain is not a static organ, but rather a dynamic and flexible one that can be reshaped through experience and training.', 'By understanding how neuroplasticity works, we can harness this ability to make positive changes to our mental and physical health.', 'Throughout our lives, our brain is constantly reorganizing itself in response to new experiences and challenges.', 'This process of adapting and learning is known as neuroplasticity.', 'It means that our brain is always changing based on our environment and the signals we send it.', 'Neuroplasticity works by allowing the formation of new neural connections and pathways in the brain.', 'These connections are created by exposure to new experiences and challenges.', 'By sending positive signals to the brain, we can encourage the creation of helpful neural pathways which replace the unhelpful ones.', 'This process has incredible benefits for both our mental and physical health.', 'Many chronic conditions are known to begin with a stressor, trauma, or illness such as a virus.', 'This causes the amygdala – the part of the brain responsible for the stress response – to become hypersensitive.', 'And causes the insula – the part of the brain that may be responsible for storing immune responses – to also become hyperactive.', 'As a result, the amygdala and insula continues to perceive a threat long after the initial stressor or illness has passed, leading to chronic symptoms.', 'Neuroplasticity techniques address this hypersensitivity by retraining the brain to perceive and respond to stress in a more adaptive way.', 'This brings the body back into a state of balance and in turn, reduces symptoms.', 'One effective way to practice neuroplasticity is through The Gupta Program which is designed to help you learn specific techniques to rewire your brain and improve mental and physical health.', 'The Gupta Program uses a combination of brain retraining, meditation, breathwork, and other techniques to heal the amygdala and reduce symptoms.', 'In addition to brain retraining, meditation and breathwork are effective techniques which can support neuroplasticity.', 'Meditation has been shown to increase gray matter density in the brain, which is associated with improved cognitive function and emotional regulation.', 'It also helps to increase activity in the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain responsible for decision-making and attention.', 'Breathwork involves using specific breathing techniques to regulate the autonomic nervous system and reduce stress and anxiety.', 'By controlling the breath, you can influence the activity of the amygdala and insula, the parts of the brain responsible for the fight-or-flight response.', 'Don’t treat yourself like a machine. Give your mind and body the regular rest it deserves. And don’t buy into your expectations of yourself. This is real self-love.', \"You have permission to rest. You are not responsible for fixing everything that is broken. You do not have to try to make everyone happy. For now, take time for you. It's time to replenish.\", \"When you're compassionate with yourself and you're loving towards yourself, that's when you will truly discover that it's much easier to be inspired every day to live your potential and be healthier and happier.\", 'If you don’t fill your mind with positive engaging distracting activities, the mind will default to worry.', 'Re-engaging with Joy is all about channelling our energy to something that uplifts us and gives us energy.', 'For instance, I really encourage you to read uplifting self-development books.', 'Our mind energy has to go somewhere, so we want to re-direct it to positive uplifting things, rather than draining thoughts.', 'The willow tree bends and flows with the wind when storms arrive, but the oak tree gets shaken and uprooted. Be like a willow tree!', 'Your mind remembers what is unhealed from your past. And each time a new situation arises that reminds you of what originally happened, your body creates the same emotions and chemicals. So you are literally living in the past.
