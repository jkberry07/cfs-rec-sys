    "PrimalTrust2 = ['Together We Rise Together We Fly. Our mission is to help AWAKEN others to discover their True Self Essence – activating self-healing and inner freedom. If you’re grappling with chronic issues such as unresolving illness, persistent pain, stress, or trauma, you’re in the right place. Traditional healthcare often falls short, resembling more of a graveyard of diagnoses than a guide toward vitality.  I’ve personally walked the path of chronic illness (Lyme, mold toxicity, Chronic Fatigue, and more) with many debilitating symptoms, and felt completely overwhelmed with the fear that I might never return to a full and vibrant life. Like many of you, I went from doctor to doctor, piling up a staggering number of diagnoses and desperately trying treatments, many of which only made me feel worse. I became obsessed with the drive to fix myself, spending endless hours frantically researching and unable to concentrate on anything else in my life. I know painfully well the spiral of loneliness, anger, and deep despair that comes with being told there is no chance of fully healing. But then I created a roadmap to guide me out of the dense fog of my illness and fear. I learned how to self-regulate my nervous system and, astoundingly, to experience true joy and calm even while I was still experiencing difficult symptoms and limitations. My nervous system started to change. My brain began to rewire. And I began to trust my body could heal. Essentially, I discovered how to embody “primal trust,” the frequency of safety and connection, and I chose to let it ignite my body’s innate healing ability. I was amazed to experience symptom after symptom fall away as I continued to lean into these tools of self-regulation and trust, ultimately being rewarded with vibrant health and a life filled with joy and purpose. Now I am called as a guide to help others do the same: disarming the danger signal stored at a cellular level through heart-led rewiring of the nervous system. Through my work in developing the Primal Trust™ platform, I have led thousands of people through their own hero’s journey of self-healing and self-discovery, empowering them with the tools needed to regulate their nervous system, but also to go inwards to find alignment with their True Self essence and emerge transformed. I give a glimpse into my story to spark the flame of hope and trust that I so desperately needed when I was sick. The capacity, courage, and power to self-heal already exists in your heart—tinder ready for that spark. Please rest assured that there is a path out of chronic illness, pain, anxiety, trauma and suffering, and that you, too, have what it takes to heal. Now it’s time for you to choose to grow that glowing fire: to break free of the patterns that have kept you stuck in a chronic stress state, experience inner freedom, and reveal your true nature to the world. You are part of a vision to reveal the self-empowered path of healing! I invite you to learn these tools and join our loving community where we embrace nervous system coregulation on this path of healing and transformation. At Primal TrustTM, we offer a new way forward—one that nurtures your whole being by gently restoring balance to your brain and nervous system. Together, we’ll release fear, re-write old patterns, and create space for deep healing. Your body holds incredible wisdom and resilience — it’s time to reconnect with that inner strength and step into a life of greater freedom and vitality. There are many ways to approach brain retraining. Some practices involve visualizing yourself in happy times or feeling calm and safe. Some approaches help you create a short-term distraction ‘fix,’ but I like to use the tool for a deeper purpose and there are many ways we do this in Primal Trust™. I often ask my clients, “What are you rewiring towards? What do you truly want your brain to help you with? What needs to be addressed on a deep emotional level in your psyche with brain retraining?” If you don’t know what you truly want and how you want to live, then your brain might just rewire itself in circles.I have found that one cause of chronic symptoms is because of unconscious stress and deep wounding that is unacknowledged and not felt. We can get so stuck in a protection response of ruminating about our symptoms and researching treatments, and our sole focus/need gets oriented onto getting the symptom to go away! All the while, deeper unmet needs of your wounded psyche/inner child get overlooked. This builds up a ton of emotional stress in the body system. I have literally witnessed thousands of people have a profound shifting of symptoms with this practice alone, as it helps the brain find and locate deep emotional longings and brings them to the surface to be seen, heard, felt, and then met! It’s like an opening that happens deep in the nervous system and allows a well of built-up pressure to release. It\\'s like the cells begin to breathe again when this practice is fully experienced, saying, “Thank you for feeling into what I truly, really need right now!” A particular practice that was helpful for me early on, which was a more specific form of brain retraining that I created, was using this practice to help me get in touch with my needs and create the feeling that I was worthy of having them met. Unlike many other programs where you “stop” old thought patterns and behaviors, redirecting to mood elevation and positivity alone, the foundational brain retraining practice in Primal Trust™ involves first bringing conscious awareness to your nervous system activation state, thought patterns and behaviors, with an attitude of compassion and acceptance; then moving on to breathwork and presencing/orienting; and finally a choice/creation element where you learn to rewire and intend to act in a way aligned with your adult True Self while embracing/integrating the parts of you that are still wounded or protective. In other words, you do this work not to simply get rid of symptoms, but to discover and cultivate a deeper relationship to your own heart and soul. We feel that this approach centered on transformation and selfpresencing helps you move away from a perspective of always needing to fix or control aspects of your life (e.g. symptoms, relationships). Instead, you become more able to focus on being present and accepting of your current situation while creating a life you love that is guided by your true values, irrespective of any imperfections inside you or in your surroundings. This approach results in a shift away from fear of symptoms and instead a focus on living. This is another key of self-healing. I believe it is essential to know what your values are, who you want to be, and how to honor your true needs, beyond just being free from symptoms, to truly heal. It is by losing touch with these aspects of ourselves that we often get stuck in a stress response for years, and this is what leads to illness in the first place. While some people may already have a strong sense of these aspects and only need Level 1 Regulate™, the Level 2 Mentorship is offered as a more advanced program for nervous system healing and transformation. In the Mentorship, we help you to heal inner attachment wounding (known as “parts work”), re-pattern trauma responses, and experience a deep self-knowing called Adult Main Personality development. In this process, the goal is to remodel memories, emotions, beliefs, and behaviors to integrate the past with the present in a healthy way that further regulates your nervous system and also helps reveal your True Self identity – that person you want to be when you feel free of limitations. The Mentorship emphasizes “two-point awareness” training, to develop both cognitive flexibility and increase awareness of what youwant and what you don’t want, so you can consciously choose how to live rather than unconsciously being ruled by habits. Essentially, the Mentorship teaches you to deeply embody an innate sense of safety, move past your unconscious resistance to self-healing and your inner protective responses, and live a life you love.Our Level 2 program helps you to find the inner resourcing to be able to hold space for the parts of you that have very charged emotional states. In fact, it is in the capacity to stay consciously present and engaged whilst at the same time “feeling the feels” of what emotions and sensations have been trapped inside of you, that allows trauma healing to occur. This multifaceted awareness state means the prefrontal cortex region of your brain is active while also not being “hijacked” by the limbic survival brain state that is active as well. The prefrontal state is referred to as an “Adult Main Personality” brain state, and the activated emotional state is often referred to as a “wounded part activation.” Think of the whole goal of this practice being the same as a comforting and self-regulated mother or father holding their scared child who is afraid of the “monsters under their bed.” The child feels the monsters are a real threat right now, but the stable, calm adult knows that what the child needs most is to be seen, heard, understood and loved without judgment. If the parent acts just as afraid as the child, then it is impossible for the child to feel safe. The goal is for the parent to listen and perceive the true needs of the inner child/wounded parts of you, rather than sending messages to your inner child and body that they are broken and need to be fixed. Instead, it\\'s about witnessing and sending the signals that you are not afraid and can relax around the emotions or sensations, which creates a powerful regulation effect in the body. Find a sense of present moment self by first breathing into your heart, noticing your feet on the floor, and looking around the room. State to yourself “I am here now. I can feel the feels and be with scared parts of me. I am willing to just be with the upset or alarm that has been with me for some time now.“ 2– Look inward now, and find a familiar feeling of fear, upset, alarm, OR a symptom that scares you or that is uncomfortable. Be willing to meet it with the part of you that is present and all grown up. Become the curious observer of this feeling, this symptom or sensation. This part of you, a healthy inner adult, has an infinite capacity to hold space for these feelings andsensations. 3– The key is to not want to fix the feeling, not want to change the sensations, and not have any resistance. If you can be willing to just feel it, be with it, listen for 1-5 minutes while simply breathing and relaxing into your heart or the area of upset. This presence is your primal trust, and it turns off the alarm signal in your brain and body over time. This is what selfregulation is. 4– From an allowing, witnessing, curious state of presence, be willing to ask about your scared inner child (part of you), or symptomatic areas of the body... “What needs do you have? How am I not showing up for myself and my true needs? Or... what is my body asking me to do to bring in more vitality?” 5– Now do your best to fully RELAX around all the sensations and emotions that you feel, like you are surrounding the charged energy with a comforting hug. You might feel both the pain and the soothing comfort at the same time. That is called “2-point awareness,” and that is the goal of the inner attachment repair work that we do in Level 2 of Primal Trust™. Again, this practice is not about searching for how to fix your body, how to change someone else, or how to prove you have been wronged. It’s about witnessing yourself, validating yourself, and showing up for yourself by meeting more of your needs. This 2-point connection allows deep suppressed energy to be released from the body, allowing more self-healing to occur over time. Our vibrant community embodies the collective energy of likeminded individuals who embrace the spirit of our motto, “together we rise, together we fly.” In all three levels of the program, we support each other through access to an engaging forum, community live classes for understanding and integrating all the tools and academy teachings, peer-led study groups, mentor-led Experiential Journey Groups and the possibility of one-on-one coaching with Primal Trust™ mentors. These opportunities for co-regulation help to ensure that you feel guided and held with love every step of the journey, providing a nourishing environment for healing. There is also ample support for private self-study, if that is your preference. We invite you to join our ever-growing community! The community element of Primal Trust™ is something we take immense pride in. Every weekday you can turn up online to join in activities to help self-regulate the nervous system. We support each other in guided practices using the tools, movement classes (e.g. dance, qigong), somatic sessions, sound healing classes, study groups, and an engaging forum. While many other programs only offer material beyond the basic lessons at an additional cost, in Primal Trust™ the live community classes and groups, as well as access to an extensive video library of recorded sessions, are all part of the monthly membership. We have designed our teaching approach to reenforce this strong sense of community. While we have taken great care to present the material in a way that is highly professional and clearly structured, we hope to also convey our own humanity and lifelong journey of transformation, as well as our love and compassion for all our community members. To empower people worldwide to embody the frequency of Primal Trust™ (i.e. inherent safety and trust in life itself), discover their True Self, break ancestral patterns and societal programming. We want to teach self-regulation and True Self discovery to create global healing of trauma, chronic stress, and illness cycles. TRUST = integrity, honesty, authenticity, safety. COLLABORATION = community with common purpose, open communication, support, respect. TRANSFORMATION = change, expansion, awakening, letting go of old paradigms. ABUNDANCE = vitality, prosperity, gratitude for all we have, able to celebrate the success of others. SERVICE = giving back to the world, helping lead/guide others, giving and receiving and moving beyond scarcity mindset. Whether you join our community or your path takes you elsewhere, your journey towards self-regulation, optimal wellbeing and heart-centered connection could start right here. A phrase Cathleen King uses to describe the brain state that she had to create in order to send messages of regulation to her limbic system. This brain state is your truest identity in the human sense—the physiological, prefrontal brain state of a healthy inner adult. This particular brain state is a whole brain state. It’s not a hijacked emotional state or unconscious parts. It’s a whole brain state where you become aware of your inner wounded aspects and stress response, but you are also aware from a rational perspective. This particular brain state is a physiological brain state of healthy brain function. It is also the gateway to what Cathleen King believes is the True Self Essence—our ability to connect with a higher sense of self. In this whole brain state, our brain firing pattern has access to higher consciousness, to be able to make decisions in times of stress, rather than our limbic consciousness.']\n",

interested to understand the specific tools and techniques in the program before they enrol.\", 'It is important however, to understand that recovery is NOT about any ONE specific tool or technique, but rather about a comprehensive approach tailored to your personal needs.', 'In order for you to tailor your personal recovery action plan using the tools, techniques, strategies and additional treatments discussed, it is key that you gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of the illness.', 'That is why education and understanding are so heavily featured in the ANS REWIRE program.', 'In other words, it is about understanding the answer to this question:', 'Understanding answers to such questions will help you to answer the most important questions including:', 'Hence the program is based on the fact that:', 'So whilst all people share common challenges and dysfunctions, that often require a common approach, we recognise that everyone still has some different needs.', 'This is why there is no single effective fix-all treatment for these conditions that works for everyone, no easy cure.', 'For example, a person experiencing severe pain has different challenges to a person experiencing MCS.', 'And in turn, a bedridden person may need different additional treatment needs to somebody that is more mobile.', 'So the program is more than a collection of strategies or a “protocol” for recovery, it is about you using the education, information, tools, strategies and training to tailor your PERSONAL ACTION PLAN for recovery.', 'It is about guiding you to explore answers to the above questions and to seek additional help from health care professionals where needed as part of your holistic recovery action plan, to tip your nervous system back into normal functioning.', 'The program consists of five categories including: Think of the program as having somebody in your life each day, to guide you and help you plan your recovery, somebody who understands what you are going through and who can motivate you to do what you need to do.', 'This is why the lessons are delivered one day at a time, so that you can build on your knowledge and give yourself time to take the action you need to recover.', 'The first 2 weeks of the program focuses largely on understanding the mechanism and dynamics of the illness, which we believe is the key for long-term success.', 'This forms the foundation for the techniques and strategies that you will learn later in the program.', 'Here we address the 4 key physical triggers of the illness.', 'This category is made up of specific education and strategies to reduce these triggers to help you create a healing environment and start your journey towards recovery.', 'This includes: The lessons are strongly focussed on understanding the reasons behind the differences in people’s experiences.', 'For example, it addresses the conundrum of many people experiencing a significant worsening of their condition with increased exercise, whilst others benefit from it.', 'This understanding and the distinctions are then available to allow you to avoid the pitfalls, and to start using physical exercise for improved function and recovery.', 'Once a foundation of understanding has been laid out, we move into a range of brain training.', 'This includes a number of strategies and techniques that you can customise to your own preference and experience, to more directly address the neurological dysfunctions, including the maladaptive stress response and pain sensitisation.', 'The training includes: Finally there are also some additional video lessons that address circumstances where some people might seek specific medical treatments, including: The lessons help put these additional treatments into context, provide some background information and share some key distinctions for success.', 'So the program consists of over 40 online lessons which are designed to guide you in your recovery journey and help you take these important steps: Understand what is going on.', 'Learn what you need to do and how to do it.', 'Take the daily action steps to move you forward.', 'The daily action steps that are part of the program, vary depending on the topic of the lesson.', 'Some examples of simple steps are: The daily action steps can also include adding specific strategies to your daily action list, including such things as: The program includes an online component and audio training.', 'The program is available online with the delivery of one lesson per day over a period of around 6 weeks.', 'This ensures that you can complete the daily action tasks and build up your understanding before commencing specific strategies and brain training for your recovery!', 'This includes 3 components: Utilises Brainwave Entrainment Technology!', 'Brainwave Entrainment Music uses an audio technology known as binaural beats as well as isochronic tones, monaural beats and amplitude modulation.', 'These assist in bringing about desirable changes in brainwave activity to encourage states of relaxation, deep meditation or sleep.', \"It's important that you feel comfortable with the Pros and Cons of the program and make a commitment to the process when you enrol.\", 'As I write this, I wonder if this is perhaps my most important blog for people experiencing ME/CFS, Fibromyalgia, POTS and MCS to date!', 'In a recent recovery snippet, I spoke about the problem with overwhelm of information when it comes to ME/CFS/Fibromyalgia.', 'And it made me reflect on my own efforts to help the wider ME/CFS/Fibromyalgia community including publishing CFS Unravelled 3.5 years ago.', 'It has been wonderful to get so much positive feedback about CFS Unravelled over the years.', 'Much of it has been about appreciating the detail on how the dysfunctions we experienced in Fibromyalgia/ME/CFS occur.', 'But occasionally, even my staunchest followers (dare I say fans), suddenly see a post or see me share a recovery story of someone who used a particular approach they don’t like, and express disappointment.', 'Whilst I may or may not agree with some approaches, in the end what really counts is when something works for someone.', 'So it’s not so much about whether we agree with their approach, but rather about understanding WHY it worked for that person.', 'The real problem is that despite my summarising comments in CFS Unravelled, because there is so much information, and because inevitably we always focus on and filter information according to our own interest, the message sometimes get lost.', 'So here is my effort to bring clarity to the whole message behind the ME/CFS/Fibromyalgia/POTS/MCS pathogenesis and the recovery framework: My message is this – ME/CFS/Fibromyalgia/POTS/MCS is a one illness, with a huge list of dysfunctions and ways symptoms are created, and how most of this happens is understood!', 'HOWEVER, treating these dysfunctions whilst helpful, in isolation rarely produces lasting results, let alone a recovery from the illness.', 'When I was ill, one of my biggest frustration when seeing physicians and alternative practitioners was that whilst their treatments addressed problems, they never answered me WHY these problems were occurring.', 'And whilst some of these dysfunctions perpetuate in their own right, or are triggered by other dysfunctions, the whole point of CFS Unravelled was that SOMETHING has to be creating all these problems in the first place.', 'And in the book I explain how I came to the inevitable conclusion, that the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) is that something and how neuroplasticity is central to recovery from the illness.', 'Sometimes metaphors are a good way for us to get our head around things.', 'I often share this one about ME/CFS/Fibromyalgia/POTS/MCS recovery: Imagine you come home, and your kitchen is flooded with water.', 'What do you do?', 'Well, it’s only natural to clean it up – wipe it up, mop it up, dry it – yes?', 'THEN WHAT?', 'Do you just say, OK that’s fixed?', 'The next day you come home, you see the kitchen floor is covered in water again.', 'Mop it up again?', 'What about the next day?', 'The day after that?', 'OBVIOUSLY, we don’t just clean up the mess without finding out what is wrong.', 'Is there a broken pipe?', 'A leak in the roof?', 'Some other obvious SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM?', 'I tell this little metaphor, because whilst it seems completely obvious that in life we look for a reason for our problems, it seems in the health world that we just focus on fixing it a lot of the time, which in my view is not logical.', 'For example: ETC.', 'ETC.', 'ETC.', '(lets face it, I could fill pages with that train of thought) Surely, the first question has to be WHY these problems are occurring, rather than just how to ‘fix’ them.', 'Because only once you address the root problem (broken pipe or leak in the roof) that is creating the symptoms (The puddle on the kitchen floor), are you really going to make a lasting change - right?', 'Hence my repeated message that I have been working so hard to make clear to others seeking recovery from this syndrome: Now, notice I said, not JUST the consequences.', 'Because of course, (returning to our metaphor), if you realised that the pipe under the sink was leaking water, surely besides fixing the pipe, you would also replace the swollen cupboard doors that no longer shut.', 'And you would ensure that the carpet in the adjoining room is dried out as well as the kitchen tiles.', 'The water marks on the skirting boards are addressed and so on.', 'If you have been listening to recovery interviews, then perhaps you have glimpsed some common themes and approaches.', 'Heard about common physical treatments, common mind/body approaches but also common changes in terms of how people look at the illness and how they approach life.', 'So how does that fit together?', 'Well, let’s start by stating the obvious – the Autonomic Nervous System is in the brain!', 'And of course, anyone who has experienced chronic pain (research has shown that the ongoing pain in fibromyalgia is primarily caused by central sensitisation where the brain experiences pain more strongly than in normal healthy people), brain fog, irritability, mood swings and sensitivity to lights, sounds and touch, can clearly see that there are issues in how the brain functions.', 'So clearly, that means we need to focus on changing how the brain functions!', 'You might even ask, is that even possible?', 'Even though most physicians trained last century were emphatically told that the brain is fixed by the time we reach adulthood, wonderful research scientists like Dr Michael Merzenich have proven that this is not the case and opened up the science on neuroplasticity.', 'Neuroplasticity, meaning that the brain is plastic, that it has the ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life, and pruning old ones no longer used.', 'Neuroplasticity allows nerve cells in our brain to compensate for injury and disease and to adjust their activities in response to new situations or to changes in their environment.', 'In other words, our brain can unlearn how to feel excessive pain.', 'Our brain can unlearn to react inappropriately to stimulus, like lights, smells, sounds and even physical stressors like low blood sugar, poor gut function and so on.', 'Of course, inappropriate responses to psychological stressors can also be retrained, but this has been long-known and much more acceptable in the field of psychology.', 'So if we want to effect change in how the brain works, if we want to affect neuroplasticity for ME/CFS/Fibromyalgia/POTS/MCS, we have to do BRAIN TRAINING.', 'But what does that mean?', 'Well, most people think of brain training as something that is mental.', 'And of course, that is the most direct route.', 'People train their brain to remember things, to be able to do special things like computations, or respond faster like you might see in a fighter pilot or athlete.', 'But brain training for healing as opposed to performance can take multiple forms.', 'A good example of this is stroke victims, where a part of the brain stops working leaving them unable to perform physical activities like walking or speaking.', 'The solution?', 'BRAIN TRAINING!', 'Their brain training is usually done with a physical therapist, where they re-learn to move their legs.', 'It’s a combination of physical and mental efforts and feedback.', 'So not only is it about attempting to engage in movement with our mind, but also the feedback from our body.', 'So by someone moving the body for the stroke-affected person, their brain is being trained to refire the appropriate nerves to engage those muscles.', 'And once they are able to somewhat engage their muscles with their mind, the learning can accelerate.', 'In ME/CFS/Fibromyalgia, the issues are of course quite different than in a person with a stroke.', 'It is more about dysfunction than injury per se.', 'But the same lessons and opportunities to retrain the brain still apply.', 'For example, pain psychologists have been using the insights gained from researchers for many years now, to help tune down excessive chronic pain for people like burn victims in hospitals.', 'But whilst it’s my absolute conviction that all people experiencing ME/CFS/Fibromyalgia/POTS/CFIDS/MCS/EMHS all share the same root ANS dysfunction, we must recognise that there is still a great deal of variation, not just in terms of the secondary dysfunctions and symptoms, but also in the way the illness is triggered.', 'And hence the need for a multi-lateral approach where your brain training is customised to your own experience and preference, but where you also support and treat severe physical imbalances and dysfunctions to assist with recovery and reduce the pressure on the ANS.']\n",

    "re_origin_text = [\"Living with a chronic illness is not just a physical journey—it is a profound emotional and psychological one.\", 'For many individuals, a turning point in their healing path comes not from trying to change their condition but from changing their relationship with it.', 'This shift is rooted in the concept of acceptance.', 'At re-origin, we’ve helped thousands of people overcome their chronic health conditions by retraining their brain and changing their relationship to their illness.', 'If you are struggling with a chronic illness and ready to move towards healing, learn more about the re-origin program here.', 'Acceptance means allowing reality to be as it is without judgment, avoidance, or denial.', 'It doesn’t mean giving up or losing hope—it means acknowledging your current circumstances with self-awareness so you can respond more skillfully and make informed decisions.', 'In the context of mental health and chronic illness, acceptance involves recognizing the presence of symptoms, limitations, and difficult emotions without letting them define your life.', 'This is often referred to as radical acceptance, a dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) principle that teaches individuals to accept situations beyond their control while working toward positive change.', 'Chronic illness often creates uncertainty, loss, and profound shifts in identity.', 'Many individuals with a chronic health condition experience an internal struggle between wishing things were different and fearing that acceptance will mean surrendering to suffering.', 'Research shows that acceptance is a powerful predictor of well-being in those living with long-term health conditions.', 'In a study of adolescents and young adults with cystic fibrosis, higher acceptance was associated with greater psychological well-being and reduced stress, even as the disease progressed.', 'Another study found that achieving harmony with oneself is a vital aspect of living with chronic illness—where acceptance allows for a sense of internal balance, peace, and personal growth.', 'Resistance is the refusal to acknowledge reality.', 'It keeps us stuck in cycles of fear, denial, and frustration.', 'While resistance may seem like a form of strength, it often leads to increased stress, anxiety, and emotional exhaustion.', 'Acceptance, in contrast, is an act of courage.', 'It requires paying attention, feeling, and reflecting.', 'When we stop fighting what is happening, we create space for healing.', 'In a literature review of individuals adapting to chronic illness, researchers found that acceptance and denial exist on a spectrum.', 'People who move toward acceptance report a greater ability to stay present, cope with negative emotions, and foster supportive relationships. Chronic illness often overlaps with mental illness, such as depression and anxiety, making self-acceptance all the more critical.', 'An accepting mindset reduces self-blame, fosters self-compassion, and helps individuals develop coping statements like “I can handle this moment” or “I am more than my diagnosis.” Through Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), mental health support encourages individuals to observe their thoughts, feelings, and experiences without attachment.', 'Rather than trying to change these internal experiences, ACT invites individuals to live in alignment with their values—despite the presence of pain.', 'One of the most exciting applications of acceptance lies in its connection with brain retraining and neuroplasticity.', 'Neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to change its structure and function based on experience and repeated thought patterns.', 'Chronic stress, fear, and resistance can keep the nervous system in a state of hypervigilance.', 'By practicing acceptance, we reduce stress signals to the brain and calm the limbic system– the fear center of the brain–allowing for a shift from a survival response to a healing state.', 'This is where brain retraining comes in: through visualization, mindfulness, somatic exercises, and cognitive re-framing, individuals can reshape their neural pathways to support health and well-being.', 'Acceptance is the first step toward releasing negative thoughts, embracing self-discovery, and unlocking the brain’s natural capacity for change.', 'Practicing acceptance doesn’t mean you stop seeking improvement.', 'Instead, it becomes your foundation for growth.', 'Here are practical ways to develop a more accepting mindset: Name what you’re experiencing—whether it’s physical pain, fatigue, or fear—without labeling it as good or bad.', 'This non-judgmental awareness builds self-awareness and reduces emotional reactivity.', 'Say to yourself: “This is hard, and I’m doing my best,” or “I can feel this emotion without it controlling me.” These phrases foster true acceptance and soothe the nervous system.', 'Instead of focusing on what you can’t do, ask: “What small action can I take today that supports my personal growth and health?” Mindfulness and brain retraining practices help you develop new associations with your symptoms and shift into a more accepting mindset over time.', 'You don’t have to do this alone.', 'Talking to others, sharing your experience, and receiving compassion can help you feel accepted and understood.', 'Acceptance is not resignation—it is a conscious, empowering choice to meet life as it is while still holding space for growth, change, and healing.', 'For those navigating chronic illness, it becomes a foundational practice that shifts the focus from control and resistance to presence and resilience.', 'By embracing acceptance through mindset work, therapeutic support, and brain retraining, individuals can reduce stress, reconnect with their sense of self, and open the door to emotional freedom and improved well-being.', 'True acceptance allows us to stop fighting the moment and start living it—creating space for both peace and possibility on the path to healing.', 'The re-origin program is designed to help you change your relationship with your chronic illness while cultivating opportunities for healing and growth.', 'We’ve helped thousands of people heal with these practices.', 'Learn more about the re-origin program here.', 'The main idea of acceptance is acknowledging and allowing experiences, emotions, or situations as they are—without judgment or resistance—so we can respond with clarity, compassion, and purpose.', 'Acceptance helps reduce stress, improves emotional resilience, and supports nervous system regulation.', 'Moving out of resistance and into presence creates the internal conditions that allow healing and positive change.', 'Brain retraining program created by Ph.D. neuroscientists and clinical psychologists to help you break the cycle of chronic illness, naturally.', 'The re-origin program is a science-based, self-directed neuroplasticity training program with a supportive community & coaching.', 'Designed for people suffering from anxiety, depression, long COVID, Lyme Disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, multiple chemical sensitivity, fibromyalgia, chronic pain, and many other conditions.', 'The only thing better than realizing you can heal yourself… is meeting awesome people who are already doing it.', 'When you join the re-origin program, you’ll automatically enter the club of super-powered self-healers who want you to succeed.', 'What Makes re-origin Unique: drug-free, evidence-based neuroplasticity training, designed by Ph.D. neuroscientists & doctors, vibrant community via web and mobile app, Live Q&As, topical deep dives, guided online workshops, a holistic approach to mental & physical health.', 'Give yourself the gift of self-healing.', 'Train your brain, Trust your body.', 'Neuroplasticity: This groundbreaking discovery has given rise to new hope for people struggling with certain conditions that stem from a limbic system impairment.', 'Before we talk about how the science of neuroplasticity and chronic illness, here’s a glimpse of hope: we’ve seen dozens of people transform their chronic symptoms with our re-origin neuroplasticity program.', 'In the program, you work through 6 modules of virtual classes and practice 30 minutes per day of re-training exercises.', 'You can join weekly group calls, group coaching, and virtual events to encourage you and keep you on track.', 'The course, coaching, and community support you to rewire your brain and feel like yourself again, all with scientifically-backed and proven methods that you can rely on to shift persistent symptoms.', 'Simply put, neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to change, both structurally and functionally, throughout a person’s lifetime.', 'This ability to change helps promote: The ability to learn new things.', 'The ability to enhance existing cognitive capabilities.', 'Recovery from strokes and traumatic brain injuries.', 'Strengthening certain areas of the brain that have lost function.', 'Recovery from limbic system impairments, commonly resulting in fibromyalgia, CFS/ME, and depression.', 'How does neuroplasticity work?', 'Our brains discard unused neural pathways… and strengthen new ones based on our habits.', 'When we experience something new, our brain creates new connections between neurons so we can remember how to do a certain task.', 'The repetition of every action, emotion, or thought reinforces a particular neural pathway in our brain.', 'The more the actions, emotions, and thoughts are repeated, the more deeply these neural pathways become ingrained in the circuitry of our brains.', 'That’s why the more you practice something, be it playing the guitar or speaking Spanish, the better you get at it.', 'Neurons that are used frequently develop stronger connections, while those that are rarely or never used are eventually eliminated.', 'This process is known as synaptic pruning.', 'By developing new connections and pruning away weak ones, the brain is able to continuously adapt to its changing environment.', 'This is really exciting information, as it means that we can actually train our brain to let go of unfavorable neural pathways, replacing them with beneficial neural pathways.', 'When impaired in this way, the limbic system continuously sends out alarm signals that stimulate the nervous system and immune system as if a threat is present, even though there is no threat or it’s long gone.', 'The combination of stressors essentially overwhelms the brain, causing it to go into an extreme survival mode in which it’s hypersensitive and hyper-reactive.', 'In many cases, limbic system impairments arise when someone experiences a traumatic event while their chronic stress load is already high.', 'For instance, someone who gets in a car accident or contracts a virus while going through a divorce has a higher risk of developing a limbic system impairment.', 'Neuroplasticity has both a positive and negative side.', 'Limbic system impairments are an example of the negative side of neuroplasticity.', 'The limbic system is the part of the brain that drives your primal fight or flight response.', 'Changes to this system can lead to a wide variety of negative symptoms and conditions, such as depression, anxiety, OCD, sensitivities, chronic pain, and chronic fatigue syndrome, just to name a few.', 'It’s important to understand, however, that if you’re suffering from a limbic system impairment, it’s not your fault.', 'Limbic system impairments occur unconsciously as the result of trauma and chronic stress.', 'These faulty neural pathways ultimately become conditioned, meaning they get stuck in an unconscious loop that perpetuates itself.', 'This continuous stimulation of the nervous system and the immune system keeps the brain and body locked in an unconscious defense cycle, opening the door to ongoing inflammation in the body and a number of different symptoms and sensitivities.', 'You can re-train your brain toward health with a few simple techniques.', 'Negative changes may have occurred in your brain, but remember, neuroplasticity goes two ways.', 'This means that any changes your brain has learned can be undone, allowing you to reclaim your peace, happiness, and health.', 'Your brain is not stuck—it simply needs some retraining that threats are no longer present and it can calm down.', 'That’s where re-origin comes in.', 're-origin is a science-backed neuroplasticity-based treatment program that can teach you how to eliminate the dysfunctional neural pathways that are perpetuating your chronic health conditions.', 'As you’ll learn through our program, there are certain factors that can increase neuroplasticity, including repetition, strong emotions, language, imagery, and other specific neurocognitive exercises.', 'While neuroplasticity is something that happens on a day-to-day basis beyond our conscious awareness, it is also something that we can actively influence and encourage.', 'Through re-origin, you’ll learn to apply an easy-to-follow, five-step neurocognitive technique to directly retrain the unconscio us nervous and immune system responses that are at the root of your symptoms.', 're-origin’s approach does not chase or mask symptoms, but rather works to rewire the part of the brain that’s causing the dysfunction (the limbic system), resulting in long-lasting recovery.', 'The program is easy to follow, self-directed, cost-effective, and takes just minutes a day to implement.', 'Plus, re-origin offers access to a community and coaching specifically geared towards helping people retrain their own brains and return to feeling like themselves.', 'Our program is based on decades of research and development and aims to put an end to your suffering once and for all.']\n",

my understanding, as clear and concise as possible as to what is going on in MECFS.\", 'What actually is MECFS?', 'MECFS has been classified at the nuero-immune institute of south west Florida, (where one of the greatest research scientist of our days, Dr. Nancy Klimas does nothing but live, breathe and sleep MECFS research), as a \"neuro-immue\" disease.Note: The neuroimmune system is a complex system of the body, that describes interactions between the nervous and immune system, which are hard-wired to each other.', 'That means that unlike an “auto-immune” disease in which the body is attacking itself, this is a disease in which the nervous system and the immune system are acting disproportionately, and have lost a sense of balance to sustain homeostasis.', 'The other systems, such as cellular, neuro-endocrine, metabolism, and central nervous system, also help to main homeostasis, and because all of these systems work together in a beautifully, highly intelligent, almost inconceivably perfect way, what impacts one for the positive, impacts the other.', 'This also means, what triggers/strains one, will trigger/strain the other.', '(Note: when I was attending, they were doing tests on rats to try to find a “homeostasis reset” button and then see if it could then be implemented into humans, but no luck thus far.)', 'What I was taught at the institute, is that because homeostasis has been lost, and the stress response and rest/digest response are both not working properly, we must work as we can to normalize the stress response, so the body can find balance.', 'All the other systems however, will continue to trigger each other, and can in it of themselves, trigger the stress response.', 'This is why brain retraining as a stand alone approach cannot work for everyone; because if you have high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid issues, all of which remain unresolved, or even mold, heavy metals or other burdens on the nervous system, those will trigger it bottom to top, which has a cascading impact back down onto the systems.', 'That is the nature of the illness; which is after all, bi-directional.', 'Likewise if you have deep trauma, PTSD etc, the same ideas apply as having mold or thyroid issues; how trauma is stuck and stored in the body and the way it impacts the body is also something that has a bi-directional impact on MECFS.', 'Whatever we do, we must try to help the body return to homeostasis.', 'The reason why mind-body appraoches can be so powerful is because of the way the limbic system, where we process signals of danger or safety and make sense of them with emotion, plays into our stress response.', \"A stress response that through conditioning and through crashes, has become more highly sensitive, resulting in a greater imbalance in the way it's triggered, and also greater physiological distress, CAN be reshaped through neuroplasticity and returned to normal.\", \"This reshaping has a very real impact on our body's ability to find balance and heal, as the rest/digest\\xa0and fight/flight responses return to normal.\", 'I believe the body is ALWAYS trying to return to homeostasis, and so much of what I did in recovery was about getting out of its way, while letting it do what it was trying to do.', 'All my efforts, even pharmaceutical intervention, were in an attempt to nudge it back to balance.', 'It was as if it had amnesia, and lost its way and I just kept reminding it of who it was and how it functions.', 'And every system that I supported, would eventually trigger every other system less and less.', 'So much of what I had to do was working with all triggers; environmental, emotional, physiological and psychological.', 'That means that brain retraining and somatics were not the entire puzzle for me; but a piece of what I call “the four pillars” of recovery.', 'Recovery for many, myself included requires a multi-faceted approach.', 'However, the reason we work with the ANS the most, is because, without dealing with our stress response, all the other systems which can be so greatly impacted by holistic methods and functional medicine (like the $15,000 I spent on HBOT and ozone therapy which truly helped), will get shot to hell if we have a huge stress trigger again.', 'Likewise, if we ONLY do \"brain-retraining,\" and this serves us to gaslight ourselves into ignoring the body\\'s very real limits, we will stress our physiology, causing negative upwards changes onto the brain and the ANS, and as a result, create more dis-ease in both.', \"If you're in need of guidance, support, have questions about my coaching, or just need someone to listen, feel free to book a discovery call with me.\", 'Receive notification for open enrollment periods for The Edison Effect, as well as carefully curated guidance, insights of living/loving & healing from Anj by joining her newsletter.', 'We hate SPAM.', 'We will never sell your information, for any reason.']\n",

    "DNRS_text = ['Founder of the DNRS program Annie Hopper, and the coaching team took a deep dive into exploring the realm of emotions and the work of Dr. Candace Pert, a former professor at the Georgetown School of Medicine, author of Molecules of Emotion, Everything You Need to Know to Feel Go(o)d, and more than 250 scientific articles.', 'We provide a breakdown of their discussion on the science behind boosting your emotional state, and why it matters when it comes to health and healing.', 'What we experience as an emotion are chemicals (molecules of emotion) vibrating at cell receptor sites that are located throughout the brain and body.', 'Emotions are powerful signalling molecules that send a message to the cell and DNA within the cell what to do – should I be in a growth state, or should I be in a protective state?', 'Positive emotions pave the way for moving the cell into a growth state, where substances can enter the cell and signal the DNA to create proteins needed for regeneration and repair.', 'We can also regulate pain signals and immune function through elevating our emotional state.', 'Moreover, our emotional state dictates what memories are accessed and what neural networks in the brain are engaged and strengthened.', 'Understanding how our emotions are impacted with limbic system impairment and how we can utilize cultivating positive emotions as a tool to assist us in rewiring our brain is pivotal to the healing process.', 'Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor, neuroscientist and author of My Stroke of Insight suggests that in a healthy brain, emotions typically last around 90 seconds.', 'Lingering negative emotions may indicate a stuck survival response, (as seen with limbic system impairment) or the story we attach to it.', 'When the world is viewed through an unconscious lens of threat, it alters how we perceive the environment, and how we relate to the world and the people in it.', 'The most common emotions associated with limbic system impairment are fear, sadness, despair, anger, hopelessness, and worry.', 'This makes sense when the brain is constantly on the lookout for potential threats.', 'Remember, this is not the person’s fault – the brain may be stuck in a survival response.', 'Please keep in mind that we don’t need to fear survival-related emotions as sometimes these emotions are healthy and appropriate.', 'However, moving into a state of growth requires that we provide the brain and body with a context of safety, and we can do so by choosing to cultivate and soak our brains and bodies with the chemical signature produced by positive emotions.', 'With DNRS we are using our conscious control of emotions (by using our prefrontal cortex to choose to elevate our emotional state, even when we don’t feel like it) to create a chemical state that overrides the threat response, and helps the brain and body move into a state of repair and regeneration.', 'This is not a process of emotional denial, rather, this is an understanding of the power of emotions.', 'Simply put, we use the science of emotion to help facilitate rewiring the brain.', 'Even when we don’t genuinely feel positive, we can exercise our brain and choose to cultivate a positive emotional state.', 'With time and repetition, we can change our emotional landscape and gain greater access to the full realm of emotions, in a healthy and balanced way.', 'In the beginning, cultivating a positive emotional state when you are suffering from limbic system impairment can seem challenging.', 'However, with repetition, it gets easier and feels more natural.', 'Using a support service like our Share-a-Laugh classes, doing full rounds of the DNRS retraining steps, and listening to uplifting music can assist you greatly in this endeavour.', 'Keep in mind that we are shifting not just to peace and calm but shifting the emotional pendulum all the way to a sense of joy, connection, love, awe or gratitude.', 'Peace and calm are stepping stones to these.', 'The more often we cultivate positive emotions, the easier it gets.', 'The more time we spend soaking and marinating in this state, the greater the benefit on our health and our emotional well-being!', 'The Dynamic Neural Retraining System is a self-guided brain retraining program that uses the principles of neuroplasticity to help reverse limbic system impairment and regulate a

condition.', 'Pillar 2: Recognize and Redirect Pathways of the Past (POPs).', 'This is an awareness exercise that allows you to identify and change patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving to support the creation of new neural pathways.', 'Pillar 3: Practice Full Rounds of the DNRS Retraining Steps.', 'A specialized visualization technique that focuses on desensitizing and resetting the nervous system while promoting new neural pathways.', 'Pillar 4: Apply Incremental Training.', 'This pillar involves changing trauma associations and graduated exposure therapy (imaginary and real) to desensitize the brain, change fear associations and strengthen positive neural pathways that lead to optimal health.', 'Pillar 5: Elevate Your Emotional State:\\xa0 Elevating your emotional state helps to provide a cue of safety to the brain, allowing for the brain to move out of survival-related emotions and pave the way for positive neuroplastic changes.', 'Get Started With DNRS 2.0!',

new neural connections throughout life.\", 'Without this ability, the brain would not be able to develop from infancy to adulthood.', \"Neuroplasticity allows the neurons (the brain's nerve cells) to compensate for disease and injury and to adjust their activities in response to new experiences, environment changes, behavior, thinking and emotions.\", 'Neuroplasticity is one of the hottest topics in neuroscience and has far-reaching implications & potential for most aspects of our lives.', 'However, the same characteristic that makes your brain resistant also renders it vulnerable to internal and external, often unconscious influences which can, unfortunately, result in people with certain risk factors developing these chronic conditions.', 'I call the conditions such as CFS/ME, Fibromyalgia, MCS and Related Conditions that we treat \"Neuro-Immune Conditioned Syndromes” or “NICS”.', 'These defence responses are all over the body, but I believe that they start off in the brain.', 'The Amygdala & Insula Hypothesis a ‘vicious cycle’ that, once triggered by severe stressors in people with certain risk factors can perpetuate neurological overstimulation, physiological dysfunction, and many physical symptoms.', 'These conditions are real physical illnesses in the body, and they are caused by the effects of a traumatic event on the brain.', 'This causes the brain to go into an extreme survival mode.', 'The brain becomes hypersensitive and hyper-reactive.', 'It is the brain which is over-triggering the sympathetic nervous system and the immune system.', 'And this is due to something called “conditioning” – It is when our brains learn to do something new, again and again.', 'In the brain, the conditioning may specifically occur in parts of the brain called the insula and the amygdala.', 'Please see more detailed information below: \\xa0 Our bodies have evolved so we can survive in our environment.', 'Our body’s number one priority is survival!', 'And there are threats that we face that can compromise our survival, and these can be of many different types.', 'It is called the sympathetic nervous system response.', 'And the opposite of the stress or sympathetic system is called the parasympathetic nervous system, often mediated by the vagus nerve.', 'This is when the body calms down and heals, rests, and repairs itself.', 'Most of our threats are actually not physical but more mental and emotional threats.', 'But our bodies keep responding as if they are real physical threats, for example, rejection or separation.', 'There are other defense responses too like pain responses, where the brain focuses our attention on the source of that pain; then it magnifies those pain signals and triggers aspects of the immune system.', 'The reason why traditional medicine finds it hard to treat these conditions, is because traditional medicine separates these two branches of medicine.', 'We have a separate immunology department, and a separate neurology department, and in fact a separate psychology department.', 'But the brain makes no difference between all of these different aspects of the body.', 'The brain simply says, “What do I have to do to survive?” and then the body triggers a unique pattern of defense responses to ensure survival.', 'For instance, when we have flu, our immune system is triggered but this also has an effect on our emotions and how we feel.', 'We feel like we just want to take a rest.', 'And biologically this is to ensure that healing occurs so that we survive.', 'Currently, I do not believe there are any pharmaceuticals that could target such a specific reaction in the brain.', 'Most pharmaceuticals or supplements target the symptoms rather than the underlying cause.', 'If conditioning is mild, successful treatment of symptoms may bring recovery, but in the majority of cases, this may not occur.', 'However, it is still important that you are guided by your Doctor.', 'Learn more the range of physical, cognitive and emotional symptoms that those with ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, and associated illnesses may experience – explaining how they may be products of amygdala hyper-sensitization.', 'Luckily the amygdala and insula constantly communicates with other parts of the brain, and that’s where retraining can take place.', 'Amygdala & Insula Retraining is designed to strengthen the prefrontal cortex and restore inhibitory mechanisms in the insula, anterior cingulate and other associated structures.', 'The unconscious brain reaction involved in amygdala and insula dysfunction is not normally under a patient’s control, but I believe that my highly specialized“brain retraining” techniques derived from NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming), breathing, meditation techniques, and others, can target the reaction and control the amygdala.', 'It is estimated that at least 2% to 5% of the population suffer from Fibromyalgia, a complex pain condition in some form, and until now there has been a lack of effective treatments.', \"The novel Neuroplasticity program known as “Amygdala and Insula Retraining” was combined with Mindfulness to create 'MAIR', also known as the Gupta Program, and was tested for 8 weeks against a control group engaging in an equivalent amount of relaxation techniques.\", 'The pilot study results found that after just an 8 week intervention, the MAIR group had significantly greater reductions in symptoms and pain, and increases in overall health, compared to the control group.', 'These are the key results from the 8-week study: 15 Brand new interactive video sessions online hot in the stunning mountains of Switzerland.', 'On topics such as diet, sleep, nutrition, mindfulness and pacing Get motivation & support throughout every step of your healing journey and have your questions answered directly by Ashok.', 'You will receive a Manual and Mind Map in the post.', 'Online there are numerous supporting audio exercises and meditations.', 'These easy to access resources will help deepen your recovery further.', 'Access to trained Gupta Program Coaches to tailor the program to your needs Full of like-minded individuals dedicated to health to help to support you through your recovery', 'Neuroplasticity – the brain’s innate ability to change and adapt – is currently a hot topic in neuroscience because it opens up many avenues for treating chronic conditions.', 'This means that the brain is not a static organ, but rather a dynamic and flexible one that can be reshaped through experience and training.', 'By understanding how neuroplasticity works, we can harness this ability to make positive changes to our mental and physical health.', 'Throughout our lives, our brain is constantly reorganizing itself in response to new experiences and challenges.', 'This process of adapting and learning is known as neuroplasticity.', 'It means that our brain is always changing based on our environment and the signals we send it.', 'Neuroplasticity works by allowing the formation of new neural connections and pathways in the brain.', 'These connections are created by exposure to new experiences and challenges.', 'By sending positive signals to the brain, we can encourage the creation of helpful neural pathways which replace the unhelpful ones.', 'This process has incredible benefits for both our mental and physical health.', 'Many chronic conditions are known to begin with a stressor, trauma, or illness such as a virus.', 'This causes the amygdala – the part of the brain responsible for the stress response – to become hypersensitive.', 'And causes the insula – the part of the brain that may be responsible for storing immune responses – to also become hyperactive.', 'As a result, the amygdala and insula continues to perceive a threat long after the initial stressor or illness has passed, leading to chronic symptoms.', 'Neuroplasticity techniques address this hypersensitivity by retraining the brain to perceive and respond to stress in a more adaptive way.', 'This brings the body back into a state of balance and in turn, reduces symptoms.', 'One effective way to practice neuroplasticity is through The Gupta Program which is designed to help you learn specific techniques to rewire your brain and improve mental and physical health.', 'The Gupta Program uses a combination of brain retraining, meditation, breathwork, and other techniques to heal the amygdala and reduce symptoms.', 'In addition to brain retraining, meditation and breathwork are effective techniques which can support neuroplasticity.', 'Meditation has been shown to increase gray matter density in the brain, which is associated with improved cognitive function and emotional regulation.', 'It also helps to increase activity in the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain responsible for decision-making and attention.', 'Breathwork involves using specific breathing techniques to regulate the autonomic nervous system and reduce stress and anxiety.', 'By controlling the breath, you can influence the activity of the amygdala and insula, the parts of the brain responsible for the fight-or-flight response.', 'Don’t treat yourself like a machine. Give your mind and body the regular rest it deserves. And don’t buy into your expectations of yourself. This is real self-love.', \"You have permission to rest. You are not responsible for fixing everything that is broken. You do not have to try to make everyone happy. For now, take time for you. It's time to replenish.\", \"When you're compassionate with yourself and you're loving towards yourself, that's when you will truly discover that it's much easier to be inspired every day to live your potential and be healthier and happier.\", 'If you don’t fill your mind with positive engaging distracting activities, the mind will default to worry.', 'Re-engaging with Joy is all about channelling our energy to something that uplifts us and gives us energy.', 'For instance, I really encourage you to read uplifting self-development books.', 'Our mind energy has to go somewhere, so we want to re-direct it to positive uplifting things, rather than draining thoughts.', 'The willow tree bends and flows with the wind when storms arrive, but the oak tree gets shaken and uprooted. Be like a willow tree!', 'Your mind remembers what is unhealed from your past. And each time a new situation arises that reminds you of what originally happened, your body creates the same emotions and chemicals. So you are literally living in the past. Find it, feel it, forgive it and forget it']\n",

peace.', 'If you want to learn diverse strategies for finding more peace, better health, and a fuller life, join me and a growing community of life-long learners every other Thursday for Live!', 'We learn new material every session, have spirited conversations and make learning fun.', 'The question of whether it is possible to recover from complex chronic diseases like myalgic encephalomyelitis and long COVID is both important and controversial.', 'It affects how our community responds to new information and influences individual actions.', 'So often, when someone with ME or long COVID reports substantive recovery, their diagnosis and personal integrity are questioned.', 'The doubts are often associated with a focus on the biomedical/biochemical aspects, which seem difficult or impossible to change.', 'For example, if one has test results indicating genetic variants increasing the risk of disease, high levels of man-made toxins in the body, multiple chronic infections, exposure to toxic mold, autonomic dysfunction and immune dysfunction (and this is far from an exhaustive list) and one has been severely ill for years or decades without any glimmers of progress, it is difficult to believe that improvement is possible unless and until medical research delivers new treatment methods.', 'While this reasoning seems valid based on conventional medical thought, an increasing number of people report significant improvements, nonetheless.', 'There are now several podcasts devoted to documenting recovery stories.', 'Many people report that their recovery began by watching these interviews and gaining hope and courage to change their daily regimes.', 'It is unlikely that all the people recovering have been mistaken about their diagnosis or are lying about their recovery.', 'Too many people are getting better.', 'How Mindset Affects Behavior Belief about whether recovery is possible affects individual actions.', 'If I think recovery is possible, I am more likely to seek out and be open to information from people who have improved.', 'I may try new things, and this could increase my chances of shifting my health.', 'If it worked for others, why not me?', 'Conversely, if I think recovery is not possible, I am more likely to dismiss information that comes my way about potential treatments and live my life in the same old ways.', 'Why would I spend valuable energy on research and new strategies if I believe improvement is not possible?', 'Can People with Advanced Cancer Recover?', 'If you remain doubtful that it is possible to recover because ME, FM, ES, long COVID, MCAS, POTS, etc., are hard-core, biomedical conditions that will not respond to unproven lifestyle interventions, let’s compare ME to cancer, a condition whose biomedical credentials are impeccable.', 'Would you be surprised to learn that many people with end-stage cancer recover?', 'End stage generally refers to stages 3 & 4 cancer in which the cancer has spread beyond the organ in which it originated.', 'In her book Radical Remissions, psychologist Dr. Kelly Turner describes the most common strategies used by over 1000 survivors she interviewed.', 'She has since extended her research to over 1500 people.', 'Dr. Turner was motivated to study remission after observing doctors showing a surprising lack of curiosity when their patients reported unexpected improvements.', 'She couldn’t understand why the doctors weren’t more interested in understanding when one of their patients beat the odds and recovered.', 'This dismissive attitude may be due to something called confirmation bias.', 'We all develop certain beliefs and mindsets, e.g., “ME is biomedical and will only respond to a biomedical intervention.” Once we have a belief, there is a strong tendency to look for evidence that confirms what we believe rather than evidence that would disprove it.', 'For example, if someone tells us there is a large pink elephant in the room and we don’t believe in pink elephants or the importance of pink elephants, we may not be curious or interested even if it sits on us.', 'A real-life example is interviews of people who almost died of SARS-CoV-2 infection, reporting they did not believe COVID 19 was a serious infection.', 'In her research, Dr. Turner found some common themes among late-stage cancer survivors.', 'I am listing them here to give you an idea of what the survivors believe helped them.', 'These strategies may not all be suitable for ME and other complex chronic diseases (e.g., the vegetarian diet) or for you as an individual, but there is a lot of wisdom in this list.', 'You will notice that all of the strategies are self-management strategies that do not require a prescription, a medical practitioner, or a big financial investment.', 'None are high-tech.', 'Nine Lifestyle Factors Reported by Cancer Survivors: To learn more, check out Dr. Turner’s books Radical Remission and Radical Hope.', 'I found them both to be page-turners.', 'Over the years, I have suggested them to many people struggling with cancer, and all have resonated with the hopeful, empowering message.', 'Can You Recover from Myalgic Encephalomyelitis?', 'Podcast host Raelan Agle has interviewed almost 200 people who report having improved or fully recovered from ME and related conditions.', 'I interviewed Raelan on June 6, 2024, to ask her what the recovered people attributed their improvement to.', 'She summarized the most common strategies employed by people with ME who have significantly improved.', 'Even though cancer and ME are different diseases, you may notice some overlap between her list and that of Dr. Turner.', 'Again, people named self-management strategies much more often than medication or high-tech, expensive solutions.', 'Could Quantum Biology Hold the Key to Healing?', 'Over the past 200 years, much more time has been spent studying what makes people sick than how people recover.', 'So, how do people recover even after years of severe illness?', 'What happens at a biological and cellular level?', 'Many of you know that I’ve been fascinated and excited by quantum biology of late.', 'It is an emerging field that provides an understanding of phenomena that biochemistry and classical physics cannot explain—things like how enzymes work, how DNA mutations happen, and how animals return from migration to the same field, lake or tree year after year without a GPS.', 'Quantum principles are explaining more and more of these miraculous phenomena.', 'Could quantum principles help us understand how healing works?', 'Quantum biology research suggests that portions of mitochondria, like the electron transport chain, function in quantum ways.', 'Mitochondria are not only responsible for producing energy but also for communicating information throughout the body.', 'It is believed this communication may occur instantaneously through the quantum entanglement of electrons and protons.', 'Can I Explain My Personal Improvement?', 'I have fully recovered from a lifetime of MCS.', 'The shift happened within a few days of beginning neuroplasticity practice, and really, if I’m totally honest, it happened in less than 30 minutes.', 'I began practicing some exercises for a few days.', 'Then I went to the mall and walked in front of the scented soap store while overriding my habitual response, and nothing happened.', 'I repeated the same experiment the next day, and again, there was no sensitivity reaction.', 'How could this happen so suddenly after 50 years of symptoms that had failed every other strategy I had tried?', 'My biochemistry didn’t change.', 'I know this from repeated lab testing.', 'Neither my genetic susceptibility nor my high body load of toxins, my chronic infections, hypermobility, autonomic dysfunction or immune dysfunction changed, yet my body functions differently now than before.', 'It no longer reacts to smells by generating symptoms.', 'Classical biochemical understanding can’t explain this sudden rapid change.', 'Importantly for me, the improved resilience has been maintained for over 10 years.', 'Could quantum biology explain how severe chronic symptoms could shift quickly?', 'If we make some of the lifestyle changes Turner and Agel suggest, and some mitochondria sense the positive change, could they communicate this to the rest of the body instantaneously, causing more and more mitochondria to come back online and produce the energy needed to heal?', 'And could this initiate a positive cycle in which more mitochondria reboot, leading to more improved function and more mitochondria resuming full function, etc.?', 'This is a very speculative hypothesis, one that I have no ability to test.', 'In my worldview, everything has a biomedical basis, including thoughts and emotions.', 'I believe there has to be a biological explanation for the increasing spate of partial and full recoveries being reported.', 'Nothing happens by magic.', 'Stay tuned to this space, where I’ll update you as I learn more.', 'I will endeavor to avoid confirmation bias and report just as faithfully if my ideas turn out to be false as if they are supported by research.', '6 Recovery Tips Here are some final thoughts based on what I have learned from my own experience and that of thousands of patients whose stories I have had the privilege of hearing over the past 25 years.', 'How to figure out where to start?', 'Start somewhere, take baby steps, and share your successes to pay it forward.']\n",

stuck.', 'To go from merely surviving to thriving and living the life you might not let yourself dream is possible for you.', 'It is possible.', 'All those things you miss doing, that you haven’t done in a really long time – traveling, dancing, walking, going out with friends, doing work you love, enjoying the outdoors… You can do them again.', 'The majority of our students begin to see noticeable improvements in their symptoms within a short time of using the tools we provide.', 'If you’re thinking you might be the exception and that your symptoms and situation are different… Know this: Other people before you have fully recovered and you are no different.', 'Just like them, you are a human being with a brain, a body and a boundless healing capacity inside you.', 'Neuroplasticity is a big reason why this is possible for all of us.', 'The brain has the ability to to change itself and form new neural connections and pathways in response to repeated new experiences and learnings.', 'We’ll help you create those connections.', 'We can help you find your way out of the anxiety, pain, and chronic symptoms that keep you feeling stuck.', 'To go from merely surviving to thriving and living the life you might not let yourself dream is possible for you.', 'You can do this because there is an inherent ability for you to heal that is more powerful than you can imagine.', 'And we’ll show you how to unlock this fundamental power you have inside the very cells of your own body.', 'The way out is through the same thing that got you sick and stuck in the first place: your nervous system.', 'In our very first lesson in the Heal program we help you learn why and how the nervous system plays a crucial role in your healing.', 'From this point forward, we’re going to focus on your brain and body’s innate capacity for change, adaptation and self-healing.', 'Whether you have chronic fatigue, anxiety, POTS, Long Covid, IBS or any of the other chronic unexplained symptom.', 'These are all rooted in one common cause, a dysregulated nervous system.', 'We’ve been where you are and we’ll help you become the confident and embodied self-healer who knows exactly what to do to heal…and live life fully.', 'Here’s how to regulate your nervous system and heal yourself.', 'Now you know that the secret to healing and becoming free and whole again comes down to you and what you have inside.', 'We want you to know that it’s definitely not your fault you’re stuck and sick, but it is your responsibility to meet yourself where you’re at and heal.', 'Self-healing doesn’t mean healing alone.', 'Getting the right tools, support, and guidance is the first step in embracing the opportunity to heal yourself.', 'Here are 3 vital things you need to know to start your path to full recovery.', 'For lasting change, top down cognitive work (brain to body) is only effective when combined with bottom up (body to brain) somatic work.', 'To heal fully, you need to become completely aware of yourself in a new way and learn how to interrupt and redesign the habitual responses in your nervous system that have kept you stuck and made you sick.', 'Healing is possible and it looks different for everyone.', 'Healing at different paces, success using different tools, fully recovered in different time-frames– IS NORMAL.', 'Right now, you feel stressed, sick, stuck – and often hopeless.', 'But you are here because you know deep down that this isn’t what your life is supposed to be.', 'And when you do the work we guide you through, you’ll soon prove to yourself that you were right all along.', 'We created Somia and the HEAL program because we found this out for ourselves and have made it our mission to help others do it too.', 'Thousands have fully healed using our program.', 'Here’s our WHY, our story… We recovered when we found what was missing from the years of unsuccessful therapies and methods.', 'When my career as a professional ballet dancer ended with an injury to my right ankle, I delved into the world of injury, pain and the mind-body connection and became a functional movement coach and Yoga teacher until I went back to university to be a physiotherapist.', 'Then I became sick with POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) and 40+ other symptoms.', 'All while teaching 30 classes a week, seeing one on one patients in clinical training, giving massages, teaching yoga, and studying full time.', 'I crashed and became bed-ridden for almost 2 years.', 'The doctors weren’t sure what was wrong but they told me there was no root cause and I’d never get my life back.', 'I did everything I could to try to heal.', 'Nothing quite worked fully because I wasn’t addressing the root cause connection and I got stuck in a push and crash cycle.', 'I was learning everything I could but something was missing.', 'I’ve been a body worker for 15 years.', 'And up until 5 years ago, I focused on structural and functional everything.', 'I was successful but there were many times where this was frustratingly not enough.', 'Plus, throughout those years, I was having frequent and acute bouts of low back pain that would last longer and longer and get progressively worse.', 'No matter what I did, the pain would always resurface.', 'Then I read a book that changed my mind about what the nature of pain was.', 'I started doing more embodied emotional work and professional training in Somatic Experiencing.', 'I was able to tap into my nonverbal embodied consciousness and awareness, really feel the visceral, emotional aspects that were coupled with my pain presentation.', 'I hadn’t yet realized a key piece was still missing until I met Jen.', 'Coming Together Jen’s focus on polyvagal therapeutics and brain retraining and Karden’s focus on Somatic Experiencing and inner child work gave us the missing pieces for full recovery.', 'By combining our knowledge and practices into an effective holistic neurophysiological approach, we were both able to fully recover.', 'Our experiences were different and that’s how we knew we’d created something innovative and unique.', 'We saw how beautifully, if done correctly , our top-down (cognitive) and bottom-up (somatic) practices play together to help people reach the level of recovery we have reached.', 'We had to share this with the world.', 'So we created CFS School where we’ve helped guide thousands of people to regulate their nervous systems to heal and live fully again.', 'HEAL is a complete overhaul of CFS School with all-new material.', 'It’s the result of how we’ve evolved and of what our students and community of self-healers have told us was needed and wanted.', 'I’m finally just living life again…I’m working every day.', 'I’m running a digital marketing business.', 'I’m exercising.', 'I’m being social.', 'I’m going out.', 'I’m going to events.', 'The biggest thing, I feel safer in my body.', 'My life is now “normal” whatever that means…My relationships in every sense have improved, I’m less anxiously attached, more secure in myself, have much clearer boundaries, and the list goes on!', 'It’s kind of mind blowing.', 'I’m living a completely different life. And it even blows my husband away.', 'I’m not afraid to live!… I know I can extend my window of tolerance safely.', 'Fear of symptoms is gone.', 'My attitude toward life is much more positive.', 'I am planning for my future.', 'I am slowly working on strengthening my body after 36 years of horrific dis-ability. You are about to take the first step to finally heal..', 'When you have the right knowledge, tools, and guidance, you can move through life in a new, empowering way.', 'Imagine being able to stop your symptoms in their tracks, soothe your anxiety whenever you need and to be able to establish boundaries and take on new challenges like never before in your life.', 'You are more resilient and strong than you know.', 'There is no limit to your ability to heal and become the person you want to be.', 'The all-new HEAL program contains video and audio lessons, guided practices, journals, summary sheets to help you become the best self-healer you can be.', 'Are you ready to transform your life, starting right now?', 'Let’s take a look at what’s inside.', 'Introducing HEAL The program and healing community to help you regulate your nervous system and heal chronic symptoms.', 'When you join HEAL, you’ll have everything you need to fully recover.', 'Don’t take it from us.', 'Take it from the people whose lives have been transformed because of it.', 'We’ve designed this program to start regulating your nervous system right away, without overwhelm.', 'No matter where you’re starting from, what your symptoms are, how long you’ve been sick, or how stuck you are, you’ll see shifts very early on as you learn to use the tools, guided every step of the way.', 'We understand what it feels like to be chronically ill, in pain, and deeply disheartened by it all.', 'So we’ve taken care in creating a curriculum that guides you from rock bottom to complete recovery and mastery in nervous system regulation.', 'Unlike other programs, HEAL is not prescriptive and protocol based.', 'While these may be easy to learn up front, when those protocols fail, you don’t have the tools you need to get back on track and can get stuck in a plateau of repeating the same exercises to no effect.', 'Here’s how HEAL works: You will get access to one module per week over 10 weeks so that you can effectively build up your knowledge and practices. You can do these at your own pace and come back to lessons and material whenever you want.', 'You don’t need to worry about doing the work on a certain timeline.', 'Because you will have lifetime access.', 'HEAL guides you on how to communicate with your nervous system and effectively change the survival patterns that have given you symptoms.', 'As a self-healer, you will be empowered to decide what makes sense for you in your own unique circumstances.', 'Not to worry, we’ll help you figure that out, too.', 'You’ll learn to heal with regular practice and rhythm.', 'You will teach your nervous system how to work in a flexible, resilient, and adaptable way which will eliminate your symptoms and allow you to live life again.', 'We’ve assembled everything you need to know to regulate your nervous system and heal and have organized it in an easy to follow step by step self paced learning platform.', 'You’ll soon see that you will experience improvements within a few hours or days of applying the new tools.', 'Let’s take a look at what’s inside: The Heal self-study course is divided into two levels.', 'Each level contains five modules of life changing lessons and practices.', 'Level 1 gives you all the information and science that you need to understand how mind-body healing and nervous system regulation work, including the wonderful science of the vagus nerve and polyvagal theory.', 'You’ll learn how to practically apply your new understanding through the techniques of shifting with a focus on brain retraining which uses techniques initiated from the mind to impact the body.', 'And then you’ll learn how to apply polyvagal nervous system therapeutics to your symptoms giving you the keys.', 'The science of states and symptoms and learning to listen to your body in the language, breath, posture, and mood elements.', 'How to influence and transform your nervous system states with brain retraining and interrupt symptoms.', 'How applying the polyvagal theory influences your nervous system, plus a collection of body-based techniques to help you regulate.', 'A further exploration of states by examining beliefs and meeting aspects of yourself that we call parts.', 'You will add more tools to your state shifting toolbox that will help you customize brain retraining to meet your specific needs.', 'In Level 2, you will learn these critical practices that bring neuroplastic and bioplastic change into the nonverbal and autonomic aspects of your brain and nervous system.', 'You’ll also be introduced to powerful trauma support and resolution tools that will help you in unwinding the original wounds that led to your dysregulation in the first place.', 'Learn new ways to tap into the non-verbal language of the body and state-shifting techniques that directly engage with your autonomic nervous system.', 'You’ll learn how to tune into inhibited sympathetic charge and discharge them through simple mobilization exercises.', 'You’ll learn to investigate states through the framework of inner child work and empower your state shifting to allow yourself to feel loved so you can provide co-regulation to your own nervous system.', 'You’ll learn about the Fire and the Embers which explains the relationship between your symptoms and the stress, attachment injuries, and trauma that are the true origins of your nervous system dysregulation.', 'You’ll learn to combine all your skills to resolve the traumas in your past and help you transform your triggers in the present.', 'There are 2 main components inside the community', 'The Forum – a private, moderated space where you can safely share and connect with other self healers just like you.', '6 Monthly Live Q&A Meeting with the Somia Mentors – These sessions are an opportunity for you to have all your questions answered about the program tools and content, how to apply them to your unique needs and to learn about the Mentors’ own healing experiences and how they used the tools to heal.', 'Note: All sessions will be recorded and archived for a month for easy viewing and reviewing.', 'Once you’ve put in the work in this program, you’ll have everything you need to move past your symptoms, feel safe and at home in your mind and body, and step into the person that you are meant to be and the life you’re meant to live.', 'When you do the work to regulate your nervous system – and it is work – not only will you heal, you will also know yourself, feel love for yourself, and experience safety and wholeness.', 'You’ll have the courage to choose yourself and feel comfortable and at home in your own body.', 'You’ll say no to things you don’t want to do, show up fully in the way you want to, do more of what brings you joy.', 'This isn’t an exaggeration.', 'Because the tools and knowledge you learn in HEAL will help you feel safe, tend to your unmet needs, repair deep wounds and know how to shift when something doesn’t feel right.', 'We’re living proof of this.', 'Healing using our approach has made it possible for us to show up here for you and have lives we love.', 'Are you ready to do this?', 'We’d love to have you.', 'Start healing now.', 'Your place to learn, heal, and grow. Together.', 'HEAL is a 10-module, holistic program that integrates top-down cognitive methods with bottom-up somatic approaches.', 'With a powerfully unique combination of root-cause focus, neuroplasticity science, habit change, trauma work, and healing injuries of your past, HEAL is unlike any other chronic pain, anxiety, and trauma program out there.', 'Your lifetime access allows you to come back to the tools and materials whenever you need them.', 'Our approach is not prescriptive or protocol based and instead empowers you to use the tools in intuitive and flexible ways to handle any dysregulation that happens in your life.', 'The program is divided into two levels with 5 modules each.', 'Level 1 introduces you to the nervous system and how dysregulated nervous system states are responsible for making you sick.', 'And you learn our custom brain retraining methods to begin shifting the state of your nervous system and start to make your symptoms vanish.', 'Level 2 will guide you into deeper layers of your nervous system through advanced somatic practices to discover the roots of your dysregulation.', 'You will learn ways to attune and to heal to what underlies your unhelpful states that have made you sick and how to use trauma healing practices to resolve the past so that you can create sustainable healing here and now.', 'With HEAL, you get the knowledge, experience, and proven support from two people who’ve been there and have come out the other side better than ever.', 'And you join the over 2000 people from around the world they’ve been able to help do the same.', 'We know that you’ve been told countless times to “try X” or “take Y,” but HEAL is a program unlike any other that puts your nervous system and the physiological root cause of your symptoms at the center of your healing experience.', 'Our approach is science-based and proven with thousands of people successfully recovering from countless mind and body disorders.', 'At Somia, we combined our clinical training with decades of experience in healing our own disorders and chronic illnesses in reinventing a nervous-system centered practice that combines brain retraining, polyvagal therapeutics, vagus nerve exercises, somatic experiencing and trauma therapies.', 'These will help you move out of survival mode, uncovering and redesigning the current patterns that are keeping you stuck and sick and rewiring them to create a flexible, resilient mind and body– ultimately helping you experience a free, health-full and whole life.', 'Although we ethically can’t guarantee that your symptoms will heal, full recovery is common among our students and absolutely possible.', 'Even if symptoms don’t fully disappear, the understanding of your own mind, body and trauma patterns along with the nervous system centered techniques you learn in our program will undoubtedly help you improve your life for the better.', 'It’s not by accident that we don’t employ medical professionals (although we have worked with them).', 'Unfortunately, many of us have at some point have likely felt stuck and misunderstood when being put on conventional medical recovery plans.', '.HEAL is a safe space for learning, growing and healing where every part of you and every experience you’ve ever lived are an important puzzle piece to your healing.', 'And while we only recommend strategies that we know are safe, you are the expert of your own mind and body.', 'You are welcome to only take part in the strategies that make sense and feel safe to you and complement our work with any other treatment, therapy that feels safe and helps you reach your goal of healing.', 'HEAL is the only program that has a nervous system-centered AND trauma-informed approach.', 'Other methods tend to focus solely on cognitive-based reprocessing therapies like brain retraining ‘rounds’ while we teach you comprehensive nervous system retraining and self-directed trauma and stress resolution techniques.', 'These address the root cause of nervous system dysregulation and the root cause of an imbalanced physiology creating chronic symptoms/illness.', 'We also teach you somatic and embodiment techniques and polyvagal therapy based exercises.', 'Students who have taken other recovery programs have offered feedback that these tend to be rigid, prescriptive and dogmatic reinforcing perfectionism patterns and high-achieving pressure – which adds to the already built-up stress in the body.', 'In HEAL, we guide and support you in learning to use the tools in an intuitive way that works for you.', 'Our program is flexible, inclusive and innovative and teaches you exactly how to move through life in a new and useful way for your mind and body.

You will learn tools to use for the rest of your life. for healing from ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, adrenal fatigue, autoimmune conditions, depersonalization, long COVID, and other chronic diseases. I would like to briefly share our healing approach with you. We view chronic illnesses like CFS, Long COVID,  fibromyalgia, Chronic Pain, Lyme, MCAS, etc., as a stalled healing phase following a stressful period spanning years or decades. Instead of labeling your symptoms with a specific label, let’s take a step back and describe them first. We are, in almost all cases, dealing with a collection of symptoms. Some of these symptoms are MindBody symptoms (fatigue, pain, vertigo, depersonalization, etc.). We can turn these symptoms on and off because they are brain-generated protection mechanisms. We also experience stress symptoms such as tinitus, wiredness, excessive thoughts, and poor sleep, which may stem from a chronic state of resistance, depending on the specific symptoms and situations involved. There are also organ symptoms (e.g., frequent urination, shortness of breath, and POTS), as well as healing and release symptoms. In every kind of symptom, there is something that you need to release. Stressors exhaust you, while resistance keeps you stuck. I think healing is a natural process that works best if you step out of the way. However, I experienced a prolonged period of stagnation myself, I know it’s not easy when you are confronted with severe symptoms. Underneath, I write my short healing perspective to destress you completely; your body can do the rest. Almost every healing approach recognizes the unhelpful state of chronic stress, and calming down will usually cause the so-called 70% recovery. We, therefore, start our healing approach with healthy habits that will calm down the nervous system. Being bed-ridden and exhausted from sleep deprivation makes it difficult to know what practical steps to take. I therefore recommend the following steps: First, start with presence. Ignore your smart phone and be here now. Perhaps you find yourself trapped in a room, gazing at the ceiling as you grapple with severe symptoms. After a few hours or days, you will notice a shift. You can become really tired, but in a good way. Connect more with the body, but ignore the symptoms in your head, shoulders, limbs, and spine. Accept them; don’t fight them. Accept your current situation. The egoic problem solver has lost; that part of your being needs to surrender. Focus on your body’s front, between the throat and the bladder. MindBody symptoms are typically not present in this part of the body (there are a few exceptions). This will help you calm down, improve your sleep, and enable you to have a better sleep rhythm. Although it often requires some effort and commitment, Connect more deeply with the stress in your body, specifically the tension between your vocal cords and your lower gut, as emotional stress often attaches itself to these organs. Breathe deeply and consciously while you connect with your body. Pace yourself and build up your activities slowly in this healing approach. Don’t expose yourself to an overwhelm of triggers. Every new or additional activity you engage in has the potential to trigger stressful emotions. Journal about them. Maybe pressure, fear, self-pressure, etc. By being brutally honest, you can actively learn about yourself and explore unconscious realms. What is your motivation for wanting things? Whatever you want to achieve, deal with the opposite that is within you now. Express yourself not only through journaling but also with movement, such as ecstatic dance. Become aware of stressful coping mechanisms and try to stop them. At these moments, feel the stress in your body and breathe through it. Through self-hypnosis, you can learn about your beliefs and reprogram your mind with new habits and beliefs. We all have thousands, if not millions, of beliefs. Some of these beliefs are negative and stressful to have, plus you need to keep thinking about them in order to believe in them. Reprogram negative (unconscious) beliefs or empty your mind completely. There are a few different ways to do this included in the Release program. Emotional release is very important in our healing approach. Learn how to release old emotions using a variety of methods. Connect with hurt inner-child aspects and love yourself a little more every day. Give up your resistance towards yourself and life. The more you understand your needs and boundaries, the more you will love yourself. Implement new habits and boundaries. Learn to say “no!” especially to your own egoic mind. You are so much more powerful than you know. Don’t give yourself away. Take your space and place. Give up the desperate fight between hope and despair. Let it go and accept that you have lost this mind game. Silence the mind and enter the realm of knowing. Remember that you will heal when you step out of the way. Work every day on all these aspects, and don’t be afraid of symptoms, as they can be a good sign. Learn more about MindBody symptoms and the limbic brain, as well as how symptoms help protect you from your own psyche. Whenever there is fear, where is it in your body? Connect with it. Don’t think about it. Symptoms are not scary, but a signal that you almost released a stressor or that your stress levels are too high due to unconscious resistance. Finidng the underlying stressor in your body will, at first, increase the symptoms. With a full release, the body will induce involuntary movements, afterwards your stress levels lower and symptoms will dissipate. A partial release will temporarily increase the symptoms. This is also great, because you will know exactly what is causing the symptoms. It is important to prepare yourself for a release by gradually exposing yourself towards your underlying and internal stressors. The more you have prepared, the smoother the Release process. Every step of recovery should be filled with joy. Let that energy become bigger in your daily life. People who are unhappy in a small house won’t be happy in a bigger house. At this point, you must retrain yourself to experience joy. If you can find joy in the darkest moments, you have gained immense knowledge that no one can ever take away from you. Joy will provide you with energy, whether it’s to heal your body and fall asleep, or to take on a small but meaningful task. This positive state can lead to stress, as it no longer aligns with your current state of being. Then you need to do “the work” again. Make fun of yourself and laugh about all the seriousness; this will help you become calmer, and maybe you can learn to act and talk slower as well. You will ride the wave of recovery. Good luck. If reading about this healing approach is not enough, then consider joining the Release recovery program. Watch the video below for a more detailed description. understand it first Before rushing into a healing approach, it is crucial to understand how disease actually gradually develops over time. In this podcast I explain the infograph called: The circle of disease. EBV, mold, candida, pathogens, parasites, immune system & deficiencies. Most secondary symptoms will gradually dissolve as the nervous system calms down with this healing approach. Guide your body to a natural place where it can do it on its own. You will feel much better once you relearn how to rest properly. It’s okay to treat secondary symptoms with detoxing or diets. However, do not expect significant results for the primary symptoms unless they are addressed. You can easily get involved in these kinds of protocols, but if you don’t deal with the real cause, don’t expect long-term results. The exhausted body and immune system will remain a perfect habitat for pathogens, and the gut still has problems absorbing nutrients. In my experience, our healing approach will enable the body to heal these secondary stressors themselves. Many people believe these secondary stressors to be the primary stressors. There are symptoms, as well as pathogens. We have, however, demonstrated that these secondary symptoms are not the cause of the primary symptoms, since we can turn them on and off with this healing approach. Before you are looking for any treatment or healing approach, you should understand or discover your original trigger and understand how ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, long-COVID, lyme disease, or chronic fatigue syndrome develop in the body. Also, learn about the secondary symptoms that are really making you feel exhausted. You can find an article here that explains the stressful personality that you have created over time. Analyze how this is working for you in your life. Find out your coping mechanisms, work on self-love and authenticity, identify your triggers, calm down the nervous system, and work on releasing old stress via our methods. Every healing approach should focus at least on releasing old stressors from your body and making you experience immediate improvements after a release. This will give you confidence and encourage you to engage in the healing journey. After that, you will need to take steps in the direction of what your body actually wants; this is usually love, connection, safety, peace of mind, and joy. To do that, you will also need to embrace your shadow side. Anger, fear, helplessness, shame, pride, desire, grief, and guilt are there to guide you and show you your boundaries. I have experienced what you are going through, and I have committed myself to helping as many people as possible. The road to recovery has not been anything near easy for me. Partly because I had to invent my wheel with this healing approach, but also partly because I was too stubborn to look at myself in some ways. After healing myself, I started in 2020 coaching people with CFS for free, in 2021 I also started offering a free recovery program. This attracted thousands of people with chronic diseases and allowed Valentina and me to experiment a lot. Eventually we had to confront the fact that the common methods were not effective enough and that developed into our Release healing approach. I think your healing approach should be as much fun as possible. Part of the fun is having humor and having fun with others. I am not a big fan of spending a lot of time alone on the internet and dwelling on the negativity and toxicity of online platforms. I do feel like building a positive place for fatigued warriors to calm down and heal together. One day, a beautiful healing retreat will exist. Dream with me. If you need some help with this healing approach, then consider joining our recovery program. It includes a positive online community and free group coaching sessions']"

Learning from a mind-body coach who recovered from ME/CFS. Accessing deep layers of healing and transformation! You might be stricken with Long Covid, chronic fatigue syndrome or unrelenting pain. Perhaps it’s brain fog, headaches, insomnia or other symptoms with a mind-body connection. No matter the name, doctors can’t seem to help. You long to return to yourself. To feel vibrant, alive, connected. To feel part of the human race. To belong. You yearn to walk on green sweeps of earth, run on rugged edges of cliffs, wade in wild tributaries of water. To lift weights like a ninja. To dance in the new moon. (Even your dimly lit living room will do.) Like a child, to create and to play! Maybe your hands want to mold clay into pots or make paper into paintings. Or you desire to parent with patience and purpose. You long to be useful to yourself and others. Stretch out your hands and feet where they’re needed. Do the work you came to the world to do. To give yourself so fully to that work, you barely notice sweat beading on your brow. You remember what it’s like to feel alive. Even if you only recall scarce moments, they dwell inside you. You must again experience this joy of being! In your bones, you ache to feel connected to yourself, other beings, the natural world, something greater than your small, suffering self.  Here’s a secret: It’s possible to open to peace right now. Yes, just as you are. Can you feel a glimmer of calm in your innermost body? Some part of you dwells in quietude, even in the midst of human turmoil. How can you reach for ease right here and now? You might start with acceptance. Feeling unwell can’t steal your serenity, even though your situation may be seismically different than you’d hoped. Situations don’t make us happy. Haven’t you once been miserable when things were going your way? Open your mind to possibility! Ignite your imagination! Your body may feel like a box of burnt matches or a bag of drowned stones. It’s not easy to endure. You are more than your symptoms. Unbearable as they feel, they are ephemeral sensations, like grey storm clouds or gold lightning bolts. If you pay attention, you may notice they shift. What you call symptoms aren’t always the same. Like nature’s fury, they might be clearing you out for a sunlit sky of powder blue.  Your body has a right to exist as it is. Sensations are not mistakes, even if they represent a long-gone or overinflated sense of danger. Trauma, or even stressful events, can keep the nervous system activated. This isn’t your fault. It’s your biology. But you have human powers of asking, listening and sensing! You might ask: What is the message in my body? Perhaps it’s time to stand up to fear, to set a firm boundary, to breathe deeply into your belly, or open to everyday joy. To reclaim what you want to do! There’s always a cool drink in a patch of sunshine or hot tea on a rainy day. There’s a hammock to be strung under shimmery leaves or a furry mammal seeking to be stroked. There’s a spiral-bound notebook ready to receive your emotional landscape. Scribble it out. A tree can transmute things you’d never tell your therapist. Like an ant in the shadow of something towering, high places can seem out of reach. When we’re wandering lost in the dark, it can become our new orbit.  When we feel sick each moment of each day, it can morph into our identity. Tiny pill baggies replace our field of dreams. We know we are headed South to the Sahara but our True North is snowed in. In such times, we must pause and reorient. Stop walking the wrong way. Find a new view. Look up towards the stars. Reach deep inside where answers reside. Allow what is present. Instead of waving your fists at the heavens and demanding “Tell me how to heal now! I’m done with this!” pretend you are a scared and wounded child in need of steadfast love.  Ask these questions again and again, without conditions: “What emotions am I feeling? What do I need to feel safe?” Wait with the patience of a saint. Shake out anxiety. Wrap your arms around shame. Watch rage rise up like flames! Let grief pull down like earth. Hold hands with fear. Place your palm over your heart. Allow the emotional visitors you’ve shut out, but do not let them overcome you. Feel the ground beneath your feet. If it helps, find someone with a soft heart and smooth nervous system to sit across from you and listen.  Whisper to yourself in the words of a lover. I’m right here. I accept you. I care for you. I want to know you. Your secrets are safe. I will no longer withhold my love because you feel unwell for this is when you need it most. I hold you with devotion no matter how you feel or what you can do. Without expectations, watch what happens. You’re not trying to dismiss difficult feelings any more than you’d wave off a tornado. You’re nurturing yourself because you are suffering. Healing and thriving is, most vitally, about loving the messy and mysterious family of you. Your estranged stepchildren need to know they belong, too. Recovering from mind-body symptoms isn’t an “abracadabra, presto, you’re gone!” kind of magic—although sometimes it seems like it. Healing happens day by day, with the constancy and curiosity of a student studying a new language in a foreign land. Verbs are essential: being, believing, supporting, softening, listening, loving. You’re learning the language of your nervous system. You’re cultivating a conversation with your innermost self.  This capability opens space for your mind and body to work their own kind of alchemy. So that moment by moment, you enter into harmony with yourself and your life. You recall the bygone symptoms with the fondness of a long-lost friend, grateful for who they helped you become.']"

We know there is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to healing, and that’s why I do my best to work with my clients on their unique needs, tying in their faith, beliefs, values, and characteristics and creating a daily practice that feels authentic to them. Healing doesn’t have to feel so hard, and it definitely doesn’t need to feel so lonely. HEALING HAPPENS HERE. Chronic illness had a hold over my life for over a decade, affecting every part, relationship, and experience. During this time I was diagnosed with multiple chronic illnesses including POTS, CFS, Chronic Migraine, Vestibular Disorders, Meniere’s disease, PPPD, MCAS, Chronic Urticaria, Chronic Sinusitis, Chronic UTI, Small Fibre Neuropathy, Anxiety, Agoraphobia, Panic Disorder, Depression, PTSD, IBS, GERD, Gastroparesis, and more recently long covid. After trying everything, and spending everything, I was still left with debilitating illnesses and limitations. I could not care for my family and found myself completely dependent on my own parents and husband for everything. I never thought I would cook again, exercise again, drive again, laugh again, work again, or be the mom and wife my family needed. I had lost my life. I was physically still alive, but I was not living. Just when I thought all hope was lost, I found my faith and it pointed me in the direction of neuroplasticity and the mind-body world. This is where healing began for me, as I learned to harness the power of my God-given mind I began to rewire my brain and heal my body. I learned about past patterns of protection and chose differently, I brought limiting beliefs to my consciousness and changed them, I faced past trauma and finally resolved it, I tended to my inner child and cultivated safety in my own body. I connected with God and found His peace, my identity, my authority, and my purpose. I know now that my purpose is to help bring hope and healing to others on this difficult journey of healing. The truth is when you make space for grief, you also make space for joy, peace, and healing. You don't have to choose one over the other, grief and joy can co-exist. It's about building the capacity and making space for it all. It's all allowed to be there. You are not along. Whether you are grieving a loved one, your health, your relationship, your sense of safety-or you're feeling the weight of the world-you're not broken, you're human. This space is for you.\"]"

    "Reset1 = [\"Our flagship, self-paced course that gives you the practical tools and techniques you need in order to reset your nervous system, switch off maladaptive stress response and transform your life.‍ The RESET program is the culmination of our 20 years of experience at The Optimum Health Clinic (OHC): one of the world’s leading integrative medical centres for trauma- and fatigue-related recovery. Since 2004, my team and I have been running a simplified version of the RESET framework at OHC. Grounded in Therapeutic Coaching™ methodology principles, this program has been 18+ years in development and is based upon my own 10,000+ hours of clinical practice. In 12 weeks, you’ll be learning how to bring together the most relevant principles behind mindfulness, NLP, EFT, psychotherapy, somatic work and so much more, so you can finally start getting to the root cause of your maladaptive stress response, and learn to calm your nervous system.Resetting your nervous system has two main goals: to calm down the body’s “maladaptive stress response” that impairs its natural ability to self-heal and self-correct; and to create homeostatic balance within it in order to create the conditions for maximum recovery. Over the course of 12 weeks in the program, you’ll be gaining a deep understanding of the nuances of resetting your nervous system, as it relates to recovering from trauma, fatigue, anxiety, pain, and sleep-related issues. Plus, with qualified therapeutic coaches in our dedicated customer support team, you can get help for any and all of your program concerns from members who have been in your shoes. Not only are they all graduates of the RESET program, but they’ve been through our Therapeutic Coaching practitioner training, too. All of this comes together in order to provide you with the most healing, restorative experience that our research, clinical practice and proven results have to offer. We can’t wait for you to join us and start your very own healing journey today.Resetting your nervous system is the direct path to healing from trauma, fatigue, pain, and anxiety.

Receive a free 12-month subscription to complement your healing journey. For key elements of the course, you will find specific visualisations and meditations to help you practice techniques and to give specific support for calming and settling your nervous system. These will focus on the psychology of calming the mind and body. Every RESET module has accompanying worksheets, exercises and transcripts that have been designed to help you digest the lessons and get clarity on your next steps each week. Through experience, you will find the tangible actions that best suit your recovery. The most important thing to remember is that resetting your nervous system is foundational to emotional healing because it’s virtually impossible to do one thing without the other. For example, in the context of trauma, when you are in a state of what we call a “maladaptive stress response” (where your nervous system is in overdrive), your system goes into a state of shutdown - and as a result of defending against further wounds it also blocks the potential for healing. This is why the RESET program directly addresses this situational challenge by providing you with the tools and strategies you need in order to reset your nervous system and build inner safety for healing. It acts as a direct solution not only to trauma, but to anxiety, pain, fatigue and sleep-related issues, too.ou will learn how your nervous system operates and how it manifests a “maladaptive stress response” when it comes to chronic conditions or persistent symptoms. You will learn different, effective healing modalities, structured in the right way, that will help address these symptoms at their root. You will learn how to build better habits that will help you take care of your nervous system and your overall state of health. You will learn the clinically proven, practical tools and techniques that will help you regulate your nervous system and create lasting, long-term recovery. You will learn how trauma, anxiety, chronic pain and sleep-related issues are impacted by a dysregulated nervous system, and the conditions they are connected to. You will learn how to balance your mind-body connection as a way of recovering from your trauma and/or chronic illness for the long term. You will learn effective mindset strategies and processes that will help you break bad habits and improve your connection to your mind, body, and emotions. The first module is all about how you can get the most out of this program when it comes to managing your motivation, avoiding overwhelm, and how to be your own best coach. We’ll be exploring the main differences that help people create lasting change, so that you can create the same for yourself as you go through the entire curriculum. In the second module, we’ll be unpacking the 5 myths of meditation and mindfulness, as well as the different types that you can be practicing. You’ll be learning why meditation as a healing modality is so important, how to get yourself to follow through with a daily practice (even if you haven’t before), and some guided meditations to get you started on the right path. For the third module, you’ll be understanding your body and nervous system better. You’ll learn how to track which state your system is in and how to rate and score its current state. We’ll also be diving deeper into the 5 energy-depleting psychologies so you can figure out which one you have, along with the 4 stages of pattern changing so you can create lasting shifts within. At this point in the RESET process, you will have established enough awareness around your patterns in order to focus next on how to break them. In the fourth module, you’ll be exploring the science of how habits are created, and how you can utilize The STOP Process for breaking unwanted habits. You’ll also focus on breaking patterns and how to create new ones that last. In the fifth module, you’ll be gaining a deeper understanding of The STOP Process while adding The Presence Process into your toolbox for recovery. You’ll be understanding why being present and in the body is so important, and learning a body-scan meditation along the way. You’ll be using these to reconnect better with your body so you can work better with it during recovery. In module six, you are going to understand your emotional style and how you are relating to your emotions. You'll also discover the 6 ways we can defend and reject our feelings, and learn why and how these patterns are created. You will also learn some powerful exercises to build awareness of how you are relating to yourself. In the seventh module, you’ll be learning how to start feeling your emotions as a strategy for better metabolizing them and releasing them from your system. You’ll understand how to create more space for your emotions, as well as the power of accepting the different parts of yourself. In the eighth module, you’ll be learning what EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques) actually is, as well as the key steps to putting them into practice. Here, you’ll be given a clear idea of how to use EFT for calming the nervous system, as well as how to make it work in the real world. In the ninth module, you’ll be exploring what the inner critic is and the 3 typical styles we use in order to free yourself from yours. Based on these, you’ll be learning how to identify your own inner critic, the RIDD Model of managing it, and effective defences you can use when it arises. In Module 10,  we will explore how to cultivate healthy boundaries. You will learn how to say ‘yes’ and ‘no’ to other people and yourself, we’ll look at the 5 key ingredients of healthy boundaries and we’ll uncover how to manage the impact of your new boundaries on the people you love. In our second to the last module, you’ll be learning what the Inner Child is, why it matters, and why it can be the biggest source of sabotage when making change. When you learn how to work with the inner child, you’ll be able to calm your nervous system in a way that lasts. For our final module, we’ll be taking a conscious assessment of your overall experience, understanding how to set proper SMART goals, and how to bring everything you’ve learned so far in order to be your own best coach so you can be well on the way to lasting recovery. At the age of 18, I hit rock bottom.  I wasn’t actively planning how to end my life, but I’d lost all hope of how to continue living it.  Having spent several years suffering from severe ME/CFS, a complex chronic illness with no mainstream treatment and no prospect of recovery, I was beyond desperate. At the point of my deepest hopelessness, I made the commitment that if I found a way out, I would dedicate my life to helping others to do the same.  I spent the next 5 years on an intense and transformational journey back to optimum health, and my work ever since has been my attempt to make good on that commitment. 25 years later, and along the way I seem to have found a way to connect my love of psychology and therapeutic work, with building organisations which make a meaningful difference in people’s lives.  For many years I considered myself a therapist by day and an entrepreneur by night.  These days I’m not sure what my job title is, but what drives me is helping others to experience the same transformation and healing which saved my life. I’m the ridiculously proud father of 3 daughters (currently ages 6-12), and so I’m a combination of taxi driver, chef (my home-made chips are particularly popular), and homework supervisor (help?). My wife Tania is a counsellor specialising in adolescents, and I consider myself her greatest challenge.  We spend our weekdays in London, and weekends and holidays at our farmhouse in Hampshire. My happy place in the country is walking our two dogs Nala (a Cockapoo) and Sizzle (a miniature Dachshund) in the woods, when on a good day I might also be joined by one of our daughters not complaining about being dragged along. For my fortieth birthday during lockdown, I treated myself to a hot tub. It was the best investment I ever made, and I’m slightly embarrassed to consider how many hours I’ve spent in it! My happy place in London is watching live music.  My music taste is a little confusing.  On the heavier side I love Funeral For a Friend, Linkin Park, Tool, Holding Absence, Bring Me The Horizon, Pendulum and Metallica, and on the softer side Ben Howard (no relation!), Ed Sheeran, Mumford and Sons and Foy Vance, to name just a few.  I also have a not so secret love of musicals… Les Miserables and Phantom of The Opera floor me every time. In terms of my personal practice, I meditate unreliably most mornings, eat a very boring diet (years of experimental treatments in my teens kind of messed up my microbiome), have started lifting weights (we have a gym below our office!), and I consider everything an opportunity to grow and learn more about myself and the world.  If at my funeral my wife says I was a good husband, and my children say I didn’t screw them up too much as a father, I’ll be happy.\"]"

    "NSR1 = ['Chronic illness is not a choice, but healing is.  When given the right resources, your body can access its natural ability to heal. This is not a positive thinking course, instead, positive thinking is quite likely a result of this course. You are in the right place. Dive deeper into what I have to offer you below. Our goal at Nervous System Rewire is to empower and help guide those who are suffering with chronic illness to find healing. We do this by utilizing the power of neuroplasticity (the brain’s ability to change). You will finish off the course with a toolbox loaded with resources and knowledge to help guide you to a life of health you desire.  Now that you have read through this whole page, I want to introduce myself! I\\'m so excited you found our page. Welcome! I\\'m Hazel, the creator of Nervous System Rewire and I want to tell you a little something about me.  Wait, let\\'s be honest, it is not a little something, it is a BIG something! Back in 2015 my journey of chronic illness began right after I got married to the love of my life. There was a lot going on at the time my mind and body was not able to work through in a healthy way. I developed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), chronic fatigue, multiple chemical sensitivities, food sensitivities, heat sensitivities, severe eczema that landed me in the hospital several times due to infection, crippling anxiety, Ehlers Danlos syndrome, depression, OCD, anger issues, and more. I floundered around in the western world of medicine to find relief and answers, only to be sent to countless specialists and given treatments and protocols that only band-aided the issues. At my lowest point when it seemed like all options were depleted, I remembered how one of my friends had told me several years back how she had found healing by doing a different type of work, brain retraining. I knew I had nothing to lose and needed to give it a shot as well. The outside was not helping me, and it was now time to turn inward. I needed to learn what was really going on in a way I hadn’t yet, because clearly the methods I was using weren’t working. This meant learning how my nervous system, limiting core beliefs, states of survival, and thought patterns were all connected to how my current state was. And let me tell you, for the first time in years I finally started to feel hope, I started to see a glimmer of light in the dark tunnel. Until now I had been spinning. Fast forward to a couple years later, there were many bumps on the way, but with perseverance, consistency, and hard work I pulled myself out of that chronic illness pit of despair to a place of health and thriving. I must also add, my Savior, the one who created and knows me so well, was the one who made this all possible. To Him I give the glory. I now live an abundant life. I no longer have chronic illness. Over the course of this journey, through my own healing, I became an accidental coach in all of this. As my cliental grew it became apparent that I needed to create my own personalized course to better help and empower others to find healing like I did. I have spent 4 years studying this type of work extensively. I spent a whole year going to classes with others doing this work and have studied a multitude of different courses to expand my own knowledge and understanding. I have seen 100s of others find healing with this type of work and have also been coaching other brain retrainers since 2021. Enter NSR!!!!! I’ve created it for you!!!!! Easy to understand, with a simple format and rewatchable videos. It is packed full of knowledge and resources to help guide you to a place of healing, and hope.  I’m excited for you to take the leap! Today I want to leave you with some great and simple options to consider gifting your nervous system each morning. I like to think of mornings like this, each morning you have an empty bucket, it is important you get that bucket started off right. It’s important the base of what is in there is going to be able to continue to support the rest of the bucket. How you start your day will leak into the rest of the bucket as you fill it each day. Lay a good foundation and watch your days improve. Did you know, that chemically speaking, how you start your day is how your nervous system will tend to gravitate towards throughout the day? If you just go on auto pilot, how you start your day will likely continue subconsciously throughout the day. Some examples of unhelpful habits that can set the tone of your day: Phone scrolling, leading to a cheap dopamine drive. Feet hit the floor running making our nervous system feel left behind and like it’s not ever got enough time, resources or even support. Overthinking and worrying about all the things in life to do, keep track of, control or manage. Symptom checking first thing. “How bad is the pain today, what does my head feel like today, am better or worse today?” This starts the chain of focusing on negative things vs what is going well and what is good in today. If you start your day in a way you wish you’d not done, (this happens to anyone) no need to worry. This is changeable still. Once you become aware of it, by making deliberate choices to switch up what you’re continuing to use to fuel you, you can switch your day around. A list to consider: Instead of grabbing your phone first thing, leave it for half an hour at least and get some morning sunlight instead. The morning sun is essential for setting our nervous systems up on the right track for the day. Instead of rushing into your day first thing, step outside and take a slow stroll. The purpose of this stroll is to fill your mind with sensory data that your nervous system takes as messages of safety. Walk with the purpose of finding detail. Notice colors, smells, shapes, and detail. Stop from time to time and absorb your surroundings. You have enough time. This can help your nervous system feel extra grounded and supported before beginning those tasks that seem to be waiting for you. This gentle morning movement is also a great way to get the body woken up. Take some time to visualize how you want your day to go. Pick an emotional state that feels good to be in. Close your eyes and imagine yourself living in that emotional state. You might even briefly imagine an activity you want to do today, and you are feeling that positive emotional state while doing it. As you breathe in, imagine that state expanding in your chest, growing and becoming part of you entirely. Do some basic stretches and positive body language. Our body language is directly connected to our nervous systems state. Feeling incapable and overwhelmed? You are likely not standing tall and taking up space. Instead, you have hunched shoulders and feel like curling up small and just saying forget it. We can help change this by adding in body language that promotes what we want. Do some stretches with your hands above your head, or your hands on your hips. Add in affirmations. “I am capable! I have what I need! God is on my side! I can do this!” Take a moment to list what you are grateful for. Gratitude releases dopamine and serotonin in the brain, which are the chemicals that promote healing. You could turn your gratitude’s into a prayer of gratitude as well. Thank your creator for already giving you everything you need to win this day and be ok. Just some things to consider in your mornings. Remember, today you have enough time, resources, support and love. Did you know that by simply changing a few words in how we talk we can shift our stories from victim and being stuck to growth and empowerment? Instead of: I have to fold all of this laundry. I get to fold all this laundry! My stage of life is so busy. My stage of life is abundant! These symptoms are scary.These symptoms are opportunities (you learn more about the message behind symptoms in NSR). I have to go to work today. I get to go to work today. Today I didn’t do very good. Today I tried and tomorrow I can try again. Life itself is a gift we all have today. Your very breath is a gift. Let’s make a few simple changes that can shift to gratitude flowing through our hearts and bodies. Shift us to a place of growth and possibilities. The words you say, the thoughts you think, your survival brain is listening. Every time you say, “I am so tired.” You are only reinforcing your tiredness. And making it even harder for your tiredness to ever go away. Your brain is listening. Every time you down yourself for how you did at the end of the day your survival brain is listening. Whatever you make a deal about, your survival brain says, “oh this is a big deal. Let’s have more of this.\" How you talk to yourself matters. How you talk about yourself, your day, your life to others MATTERS. It makes such a difference it literally will change your physiology, make you sick and keep you stuck. This goes both ways, good and bad. That is what is so cool about how we are made. There is hope, there is change on the horizon to grasp onto! Let me know in the comments how you can reword something from your day!']"

    "BR101_1 = ['How hundreds of people around the world have recovered from ME/CFS and Long Covid, without medication, drastic diet changes, or expensive therapies. And now you can too. If you’re currently facing ME/CFS or Long Covid, you’ll want to keep reading. If you are dealing with persistent unexplainable symptoms, nervous system regulation could be the issue. Have you been to multiple doctors without answers? Have you been told \"your tests are normal\" or \"it\\'s just stress\"? Have you tried countless treatments with little improvement? If this is what you\\'ve been facing, I want you to know three important things: Your symptoms are 100% real (not just in your head). There is a scientific explanation for what you\\'re going through. You can get better - hundreds of people already have. If you’re reading this you’ve probably already seen some of my YouTube videos, but just in case you haven’t, I want to introduce myself. I’m Raelan Agle, and I lived with ME/CFS for ten years. I know the frustration of negative test results, doctors who lack answers, and well-meaning friends who just don\\'t understand. After years of searching and thousands of dollars spent on treatments that didn\\'t work, I discovered that the key isn’t more medications, expensive therapies, or just accepting that I would have to live with ME/CFS for the rest of my life. In fact, I already had everything I needed to recover (And you do too.) I just needed to use the brain\\'s natural ability to rewire itself to address the root cause of my symptoms: a nervous system stuck in protection mode. Since recovering, I\\'ve interviewed over 225 people who\\'ve healed from similar conditions. Through my extensive research combined with insights revealed from these conversations, I\\'ve identified the key brain retraining principles that make the difference between continued suffering and healing. From this, I put the most essential brain training concepts and exercises into a practical and easy-to-follow course. Brain Retraining 101 teaches the fastest way I know of to get results with brain retraining. I’ll be the first to say that you can recover without a course like this. I did, and so have many others. In fact, you can find 99% of my content online for free in various formats. But if you want all the information and strategies together in one place in a structured approach, this course is for you. And everything in Brain Retraining 101 is scientifically proven to work, so you won’t waste any more time on “solutions” that don’t actually help. It’s also laid out in such a way that you’ll learn everything at exactly the right time and in the right order, so you’re always building upon your new knowledge. Most importantly, this course is designed to help you take action right now, from wherever you are currently. You’ll learn how to deal with your symptoms and get better. First in small ways, like being able to eat your favorite food again, go for a walk around the block, or have a conversation with your loved ones. Then we’ll show you how you can build up more and more so you can change your life in big ways, fully confident that you can deal with anything your condition throws at you. And since I know dealing with ME/CFS can be a lonely, isolating experience, I’ve also provided ways for you to connect with other course participants, both on our weekly support calls and off them. More about that in a minute, but first you need to understand why you haven’t heard about this approach to healing until now. In the past decade, major breakthroughs in our understanding of the nervous system have shown how chronic symptoms actually work. These breakthroughs explain why you can experience severe, debilitating symptoms and still get a clean bill of health from your doctor. More research is being done and awareness is growing, but it can take years for scientific discoveries to make their way into doctor\\'s offices. The good news is that you don’t have to wait years because Brain Retraining 101 brings this cutting-edge understanding to you now, in an accessible format designed for healing. Knowing that you aren’t alone It might seem odd for me to include this here, but this is SO important. If you’re like many of us who have dealt with ME/CFS, joining this course might be the very first time you’ve been around others who understand. This is an indescribable feeling, and it can be the extra boost you need on those extra challenging days. I created this course with YOU in mind. As someone who lived with ME/CFS for 10 years, I’ve been where you are. I know how difficult it can be to function on particularly bad days. That’s why I designed every aspect of this course to make sure you can start feeling better, no matter how severe your symptoms are. The bite-sized videos let you engage at your own pace, while still learning something that supports your recovery every time you open the course. The weekly live support calls provide a space where you can ask questions without fear of judgement, share your experience, and connect with others who truly understand what you’re going through. The science-based approach we share explains the \"why\" behind your symptoms and recovery techniques, without overwhelming you with details that won’t actually help you get better. Then we give you simple methods to retrain your brain, distilled from the insights of hundreds of recovery stories… All so you have a clear path forward, no matter where you’re starting from. Brain Retraining is the most reliable way I know of to reclaim your life from chronic illness, and you can start right now. These concepts have helped hundreds of people reduce or completely eliminate their symptoms. You deserve that, and I believe that recovery is completely possible for you. If anything I’ve shared on my YouTube channel or this page resonates, Brain Retraining 101 could be the perfect next step for you. I would love to see you live on our next Friday support call! Hello! I’m Raelan Agle, an author, YouTuber, and soon-to-be podcaster. Over the past 4 years, I’ve produced over 400 YouTube videos, amassing nearly 3 million views—and the numbers keep growing. My mission is to empower you with the tools needed for recovery from conditions like chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and long-haul COVID, without having to spend months (or years) looking for answers or having to spend a fortune in the process. There’s a lot of information out there and often that information overload is what keeps you from success. Check out this video where I show you how to zero in and find what you need for you. My intimate understanding of ME/CFS is not just professional—it’s personal. Not only have I personally lived with ME/CFS, I also grew up with a mother who had this debilitating condition. She got sick when I was 5 years old and remained sick for the duration of her life. Perhaps as a response to witnessing her limitations, before I had ME/CFS I dedicated myself to living as fully as possible. I was always working, was pursuing multiple university degrees, and often worked out 6 times a week, sometimes up to 3 hours per day. I traveled, I partied, and I pushed myself to my absolute limits. I never rested. Somehow despite my mother’s struggles, it seems I thought I was invincible. At 30 years old, after a bad flu that just didn’t seem to want to go away, I, too, was eventually diagnosed with ME/CFS. Getting ME/CFS, after what I’d seen my mother go through, felt like a death sentence. I was terrified, overwhelmed, depressed, anxious, and in shock. I had to quit my job, take a long-term disability leave from university, stop going to the gym, stop socializing, and stop doing pretty much everything else I was used to doing. I would curl up on the bathroom floor some days and just cry uncontrollably. I felt like I had been kidnapped from my life and I just wanted my old life back so badly. And no one had answers. All my medical tests came back normal and my GP told me I was fine. As I continued to search for a way out of this, I did everything under the sun that both conventional and alternative medicine told me to do to get better and it didn’t get me very far. After a couple of years of this, I stopped believing I was going to get better. I stopped trying. My marriage ended and I had to move back home with my father. I was in a really hopeless place — I was single, lonely, and undateable, I was sure. No one would ever want me or love me again. My whole identity, both the one I’d had and the one I’d been trying to build prior to getting sick felt like they were no longer in reach for me. But as time passed and my frustration with this horrible chronic illness approached its limits, I reached a pivotal moment. I transitioned from feeling like I should get serious about recovery again to knowing I MUST. With renewed determination, I devised a new plan for recovery. Though the journey was longer and more challenging than anticipated, I fully recovered after about two years on this new path, marking a decade since my diagnosis. This profound experience reshaped me. I no longer yearned for my previous life but emerged as someone new—someone I truly admire. And this new version of myself is passionately committed to supporting others on their paths to recovery.']"
